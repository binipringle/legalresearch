# Federal

## U.S. Supreme Court

1. **U.S. Reports** (Official reporter): **U.S.** e.g., *Panetti v. Quarterman,* 551 U.S. 930 (2007).

2. **Supreme Court Reporter** (Unofficial Westlaw): **S.Ct.** e.g., *Panetti v. Quarterman,* 127 S.Ct.2842 (2007).

3. **Lawyer’s Edition** (Unofficial Lexis): **L.Ed.** e.g., *Panetti v. Quarterman,* 168 L.Ed.2d 662 (2007).

“Parallel Citation:” *Panetti v. Quarterman,* 551 U.S. 930, 127 S.Ct. 2842, 168 L.Ed.2d 662 (2007)

## Federal Circuit Courts of Appeals

1. **Federal Reporter** (Unofficial Westlaw): **F., F.2d, F.3d** e.g., *Richter v. Westab, Inc.,* 529 F.2d 896 (6th Cir. 1976); *Burke v. Nat’l Broadcasting Co.,* 598 F.2d 688 (1st Cir. 1979); *Dr. Seuss Enterp. v. Comic Mix LLC,* 983 F.3d 443 (9th Cir. 2020).

NOTE: F.3d does NOT mean 3d Circuit. F.2d does NOT mean 2d Circuit.

NOTE: Case law from federal circuit court is only mandatory in that circuit. 9th circuit opinion is mandatory in 9th circuit, but only persuasive in 2d circuit.

## Federal District Courts

1. **Federal Supplement** (Unofficial Westlaw): **F. Supp., F. Supp. 2d, F. Supp. 3d** e.g., *Waite v. UMG Recordings, Inc.,* 477 F. Supp. 3d 265 (S.D.N.Y. 1976); *Waring v. Dunlea,* 26 F. Supp. 338 (D. Mar. 1939).

NOTE: if I see a partial citation that says 343 F. Supp. 2d 260, I know this is a federal District Court, and I know it is not mandatory authority because trial courts do not bind other courts, therefore only persuasive.

NOTE: District courts located in each circuit are only bound to follow the decisions of the U.S. Supreme Court and the Circuit Court of Appeals for their particular circuit.

2. **N.Y. Supplement** (Unofficial Westlaw): **N.Y.S., N.Y.S.2dA** e.g., *Ellington v. EMI Music, Inc.,* 997 N.Y.S.2d 339 (2014).

3. **N.E. Reporter** (Unofficial Westlaw): **N.E., N.E.2dA** e.g., *Ellington v. EMI Music,* Inc., 21 N.E.3d 1000 (2014)

## N.Y. Appellate Division

1. **Appellate Division Reports** (Official reporter): **A.D, A.D.2d, A.D.3dA** e.g., *Kreir v. Krier,* 178 A.D.3d 1372 (4th Dep’t 2019).

NOTE: difference between Court of Appeals and Appellate Division is in parenthesis before year. If only year, Court of Appeals. If Dep't specified in parenthesis, Apellate Division. If partial citation without year, I don't know which court.

## N.Y. Supreme Courts

1. **Miscellaneous Reports** (Official reporter): **Misc., Misc. 2d, Misc. 3dA** e.g., *Scotti v. Tough Mudder Inc.,* 63 Misc. 3d 843 (Sup. Ct. Kings Cty. 2019).

“Parallel citation” (sometimes): *Scotti v. Tough Mudder Inc.,* 63 Misc. 843, 97 N.Y.S.3d 825 (Sup. Ct. Kings Cty. 2019)

If I see a partial citation, such as 64 Misc. 2d 243, I know this opinion is only persuasive because trial courts do not bind other trial courts.
