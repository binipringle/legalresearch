Adapted from Douglas Cox's [Mini Playbook](http://www.alr.legalresearch.nyc/playbook.pdf)

I have nothing. *Start with secondary sources*

1. read for background, context and to find statutes and cases
2. Treatises and Practitioner materials best
3. Legal Encyclopedia good
4. Westlaw and Lexis have different sources so try both
5. some secondary sources are only in print so go to library and ask

I have a statute section. *Go to annotated code*

1. check statutory scheme (toc) for bigger picture
2. McKinney's (NY): read Practice Commentaries for background, context, related statutes, cases, etc.
3. Notes of Decisions: look for selected cases
4. Context & Analysis: possible secondary sources
5. use Citing References or Shepard's to locate and search (a) a poolo of all cases and (b) secondary sources citing the statute

I have a case. *Read and find more*

1. Cases cited in my case
2. Subsequent cases that cite my case (Shepard's of Citing References)
3. Headnotes/Topic & Key numbers
4. use Citing References or Shepard's to locate and search (a) a poolo of all cases and (b) secondary sources citing the statute

Then, *read secondary sources > read secondary sources*


Wherever I start, I go around and around:

*start with secondary sources > go to annotated code > read case and find more > read secondary sources > read secondary sources > read secondary sources > go to annotated code > read case and find more > read secondary sources > read secondary sources > read secondary sources > go to annotated code > read case and find more > read secondary sources > read secondary sources > read secondary sources > go to annotated code > read case and find more > read secondary sources > read secondary sources > read secondary sources > go to annotated code > read case and find more > read secondary sources > read secondary sources > read secondary sources > go to annotated code > read case and find more > read secondary sources > read secondary sources > read secondary sources > go to annotated code > read case and find more > read secondary sources > read secondary sources > read secondary sources > go to annotated code > read case and find more > read secondary sources > read secondary sources > read secondary sources > go to annotated code > read case and find more > read secondary sources > read secondary sources > read secondary sources > go to annotated code > read case and find more > read secondary sources > read secondary sources > read secondary sources > go to annotated code > read case and find more > read secondary sources > read secondary sources > read secondary sources > go to annotated code > read case and find more > read secondary sources > read secondary sources > read secondary sources > go to annotated code > read case and find more > read secondary sources > read secondary sources > read secondary sources > go to annotated code*

I'm done when I start running into the same cases in all the different places.
