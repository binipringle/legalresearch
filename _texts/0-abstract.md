First day of class

Rule 1: go to the Library

Sometimes a smaller library is good. It's good to have an understanding of books. A public interest law firm will have books specific to its area.

Usually the irresistible urge will be to go to Westlaw. There used to be a librarian at Fordham who called Westlaw "the white box of death." Doug calls it a hot tub full of your friends.

One of the few books on criminal law in New York includes a discussion of whether a statement made by the defendant on the witness stand that is different from a statement that was suppressed because it wasn't mirandaized and another that was coerced would be admissable - impeachable.

 

# Government power and the Law

- **statutes** are enacted by the legislative branch of government
- **executive orders** and **Presidential proclamations** are issued by the executive branch of government (a.k.a. the administrative brance)
- The executive branch includes specialized administrative agencies created through legislative statutes or executive orders. These specialized agencies can issue **regulations** that implement the policies and directives of Congress and the President.
- **cases** are decided by the judicial branch of government. The courts apply law to facts to determine if laws were broken, and also determine the legality of statutes or regulations. Judicial opinions create law in areas not covered by statutes or regulations. Judge-created law is common law.

# Federal and State jurisdictions

Some matters fall exclusively under federal federal law and others under state law.

- Federal courts have jurisdiction over any issue involving a federal statute, a treaty, or the U.S. Constitution.
- State governments control torts, contracts, family law and other cases.
- In some areas, such as environmental law, tax law, and labor law, both federal and state laws could apply, sometimes giving the party initiating the lawsuit a choice of whether to file the case in a Federal or state court system.

# Understanding legal authority

## 1. Sources of authority

**a. Primary sources**

- statutes enacted by the legislature;
- regulations and decisions of administrative agencies, as well as executive ordders and Presidential proclamations; and
- court opinions written by the judiciary.

**b. Secondary sources**

- anything pertaining to the law that is not considered a primary source. Can be analysis of law, critique of law, explanation of legal strategy, legal practice tips and so on.

## 2. Weight of authority

In order for a law to be binding, it must be considered mandatory authority in the jurisdiction where the case is brought.

**a. Mandatory authority**

- statutes, administrative law, cases

**b. Persuasive authority**

Courts have discretion to consider non-mandatory primary and secondary sources as persuasive authority. Sometimes primary law sources from another jurisdiction can be used persuasively. Secondary sources can sometimes be used persuasively too. Both can play a role in situations such as:

- convincing a court how the law should be applied to particular facts;
- challenging how laws have been applied in the past;
- cases involving areas of law that are unsettled in a jurisdiction but may have been decided elsewhere; and
- challenging the validity of the laws themselves.

## 3. Case authority - additional considerations

**a. Precedent: stare decisis**

- deciding cases in accordance with established precedent lends predictability and stability to the law and society, and enables people their actions with some degree of confidence that legal disputes will be handled fairly by the courts.

**b. Court system structure**

The court system in a given jurisdiction affects which cases will hold mandatory authority. Usually three-tiered structure:

- Trial courts
- Intermediate-level appellate courts
- Final appellate courts

**c. Cases - which parts are considered binding**

Only the text in the opinion section of the case document contains the law. Sometimes more than one opinion is included in published cases and their precedential value is not equal.

**i. Holding versus Dictum**

- The “holding” is the part of the opinion that bears directly on the issue at hand and is considered the law.
- “ratio decidendi” is when the court explains its reasoning in arriving at its holding. This is also considered mandatory authority.
- “Dictum” is any statement contained in a case opinion that doesn’t relate directly to the issue at hand or speculates about other situations or facts not present in the current case. Dictum contained in an opinion is not mandatory, even though the other parts of the opinion that do pertain to the issue are mandatory.

**ii. Majority, Concurring, Plurality, and Dissenting Opinions**

Most cases contain a single written opinion that constitutes the court’s decision, but appellate cases are usually decided by more than one judge. If there’s disagreement among them regarding the outcome or the reasoning there will be more than one opinion written.
If there are is more than one opinion, one of the opinions is controlling, and only it will hold mandatory authority in the court’s jurisdiction.

- The **majority opinion** is always the one that more than half of the judges deciding the case have signed onto. It’s also referred to as the opinion of the court. When a majority opinion exists, it is controlling and constitutes the law. The majority opinion will appear before any other opinions included in the case document.
- **Concurring opinions** agree with the outcome of a case, but they do so for different reasons. When there is a majority opinion in a case, the concurring opinion cannot be considered mandatory because the rationale of a concurring opinion differs in some way from the majority. However, a concurring opinion can sometimes be considered to hold mandatory authority when no opinion has the support of a majority of the judges, as explained in the next paragraph on plurality opinions.
- **Plurality opinions** exist in cases where the majority of judges agree on the outcome of the case but no opinion has the support of the majority. In other words, although a majority of judges concur in the outcome, they don’t agree on the reasons for it. *In this situation, the opinion in favor of the winning party that has the most support among the judges is the plurality opinion.* However, the plurality opinion is not automatically the controlling one. The U.S. Supreme Court stated in Marks v. United States that when no opinion has the support of the majority, the controlling opinion will be the one that decided the issue on the narrowest grounds. This means where there is no majority opinion, a concurring opinion could be considered controlling if it fits the Supreme Court’s criteria better than the plurality opinion. Interpreting this rule has created some confusion in later cases, but you should be aware that *when there is no majority opinion in a case you want to use you will have to do additional research to determine whether the plurality or a concurring opinion is controlling.*
- **Dissenting opinions** are never considered mandatory as they disagree with the outcome of the case, either in whole or in part. However, sometimes a dissent proposes changes in the law or contains an insightful analysis that can be used persuasively in later cases to challenge established precedent.

## 4. Updating Legal Sources

An important theme throughout the process of legal research is updating the sources you find to make sure the law you are relying on is still current. As you learn more about the different types of legal sources discussed in later chapters, you will learn how to determine whether each source you are looking at reflects the current status of the law and which sources can no longer be relied on or should only be used with caution.

**D. The Federal Court System**

1. Trial Courts are called the United States District Courts. There are 94 Federal district courts, with at least one in every state as well as the District of Columbia and in certain United States Territories. In more populous states there are several Federal district courts covering different geographic regions. For example, New York has four separate Federal district courts serving different geographical regions of the state: Northern, Southern, Eastern and Western. Each Federal district also has a separate bankruptcy court, and there are additional federal subject specific trial courts for tax, international trade, and claims against the government that have nationwide jurisdiction.
2. Intermediate-Level Courts: intermediate-level appellate courts are divided into separate circuits. In the Federal system, the district courts located in each circuit are only bound to follow the decisions of the U.S. Supreme Court and the Circuit Court of Appeals for their particular circuit. For example, Federal district courts in New York appeal to the 2d Circuit Court of Appeals, so decisions from that higher court are binding on them. However, Federal district courts in New York are not bound by decisions of the 11th Circuit Court of Appeals or any other circuit court besides the 2d. As a result, 11th Circuit
