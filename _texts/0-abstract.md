# Government power and the Law

- **statutes** are enacted by the legislative branch of government
- **executive orders** and **Presidential proclamations** are issued by the executive branch of government (a.k.a. the administrative brance)
- The executive branch includes specialized administrative agencies created through legislative statutes or executive orders. These specialized agencies can issue **regulations** that implement the policies and directives of Congress and the President.
- **cases** are decided by the judicial branch of government. The courts apply law to facts to determine if laws were broken, and also determine the legality of statutes or regulations. Judicial opinions create law in areas not covered by statutes or regulations. Judge-created law is common law.

# Federal and State jurisdictions
