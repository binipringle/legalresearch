# Government power and the Law

- **statutes** are enacted by the legislative branch of government
- **executive orders** and **Presidential proclamations** are issued by the executive branch of government (a.k.a. the administrative brance)
- The executive branch includes specialized administrative agencies created through legislative statutes or executive orders. These specialized agencies can issue **regulations** that implement the policies and directives of Congress and the President.
- **cases** are decided by the judicial branch of government. The courts apply law to facts to determine if laws were broken, and also determine the legality of statutes or regulations. Judicial opinions create law in areas not covered by statutes or regulations. Judge-created law is common law.

# Federal and State jurisdictions

Some matters fall exclusively under federal federal law and others under state law. For example, Federal courts have jurisdiction over any issue involving a federal statute, a treaty, or the U.S. Constitution. Other areas of law are mostly under the
control of state governments, such as torts, contracts, and family law cases. In some areas, such as environmental law, tax law, and labor law, both federal and state laws could apply, sometimes giving the party initiating the lawsuit a choice of whether to file the case in a Federal or state court system.

# Understanding legal authority

1. Sources of authority

a. Primary sources:

- statutes enacted by the legislature;
- regulations and decisions of administrative agencies, as well as executive ordders and Presidential proclamations; and
- court opinions written by the judiciary.

b. Secondary sources

- anything pertaining to the law that is not considered a primary source. Can be analysis of law, critique of law, explanation of legal strategy, legal practice tips and so on.

2. Weight of authority

In order for a law to be binding, it must be considered mandatory authority in the jurisdiction where the case is brought.

a. Mandatory authority

- statutes, administrative law, cases

b. Persuasive authority

Courts have discretion to consider non-mandatory primary and secondary sources as persuasive authority. Sometimes primary law sources from another jurisdiction can be used persuasively. Secondary sources can sometimes be used persuasively too. Both can play a role in situations such as:

- convincing a court how the law should be applied to particular facts;
- challenging how laws have been applied in the past;
- cases involving areas of law that are unsettled in a jurisdiction but may have been decided elsewhere; and
- challenging the validity of the laws themselves.

3. Case authority - additional considerations

a. precedent: stare decisis

- deciding cases in accordance with established precedent lends predictability and stability to the law and society, and enables people their actions with some degree of confidence that legal disputes will be handled fairly by the courts.

b. Court system structure

The court system in a given jurisdiction affects which cases will hold mandatory authority. Usually three-tiered structure:

- Trial courts
- Intermediate-level appellate courts
- Final appellate courts

c. Cases - which parts are considered binding
