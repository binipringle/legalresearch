First day of class

Rule 1: go to the Library

Sometimes a smaller library is good. It's good to have an understanding of books. A public interest law firm will have books specific to its area.

Usually the irresistible urge will be to go to Westlaw. There used to be a librarian at Fordham who called Westlaw "the white box of death." Another law librarian called it a hot tub full of friends (cronies).

One of the few books on criminal law in New York includes a discussion of whether a statement made by the defendant on the witness stand that is different from a statement that was suppressed because it wasn't mirandaized and another that was coerced would be admissable - impeachable.

What does it mean that the statement is impeachable?  

# Government power and the Law

- **statutes** are enacted by the legislative branch of government
- **executive orders** and **Presidential proclamations** are issued by the executive branch of government (a.k.a. the administrative brance)
- The executive branch includes specialized administrative agencies created through legislative statutes or executive orders. These specialized agencies can issue **regulations** that implement the policies and directives of Congress and the President.
- **cases** are decided by the judicial branch of government. The courts apply law to facts to determine if laws were broken, and also determine the legality of statutes or regulations. Judicial opinions create law in areas not covered by statutes or regulations. Judge-created law is common law.

# Federal and State jurisdictions

- Federal courts have jurisdiction over any issue involving a federal statute, a treaty, or the U.S. Constitution.
- State governments control torts, contracts, family law and other cases.
- In some areas, such as environmental law, tax law, and labor law, both federal and state laws could apply, sometimes giving the party initiating the lawsuit a choice of whether to file the case in a Federal or state court system.

# Understanding legal authority

Map: (1) U.S. Constitution

- Article 1 legislative branch - (2) statutes // codes
- Article 2 executive branch - (3) regulations
- Article 3 judicial branch - (4) case law

## 1. Sources of authority

**a. Primary sources**

- statutes enacted by the legislature;
- regulations and decisions of administrative agencies, as well as executive ordders and Presidential proclamations; and
- court opinions written by the judiciary.

**b. Secondary sources**

- anything pertaining to the law that is not considered a primary source. Can be analysis of law, critique of law, explanation of legal strategy, legal practice tips and so on.

## 2. Weight of authority

In order for a law to be binding, it must be considered mandatory authority in the jurisdiction where the case is brought.

**a. Mandatory authority**

- statutes, administrative law, cases

*ideal* case law

mandatory precedent - with similar facts - that is still good law - with good legal reasoning - that is often cited - and is relatively recent

**b. Persuasive authority**

Courts have discretion to consider non-mandatory primary and secondary sources as persuasive authority. Sometimes primary law sources from another jurisdiction can be used persuasively. Secondary sources can sometimes be used persuasively too. Both can play a role in situations such as:

- convincing a court how the law should be applied to particular facts;
- challenging how laws have been applied in the past;
- cases involving areas of law that are unsettled in a jurisdiction but may have been decided elsewhere; and
- challenging the validity of the laws themselves.

## 3. Case authority - additional considerations

**a. Precedent: stare decisis**

- deciding cases in accordance with established precedent lends predictability and stability to the law and society, and provides some degree of confidence that legal disputes will be handled fairly by the courts.

**b. Court system structure**

The court system in a given jurisdiction affects which cases will hold mandatory authority. Usually three-tiered structure:

- Trial courts
- Intermediate-level appellate courts
- Final appellate courts

**c. Cases - which parts are considered binding**

Only the text in the opinion section of the case document contains the law. Sometimes more than one opinion is included in published cases and their precedential value is not equal.

**i. Holding versus Dictum**

- The “holding” is the part of the opinion that bears directly on the issue at hand and is considered the law.
- “ratio decidendi” is when the court explains its reasoning in arriving at its holding. This is also considered mandatory authority.
- “Dictum” is any statement contained in a case opinion that doesn’t relate directly to the issue at hand or speculates about other situations or facts not present in the current case. Dictum contained in an opinion is not mandatory, even though the other parts of the opinion that do pertain to the issue are mandatory.

**ii. Majority, Concurring, Plurality, and Dissenting Opinions**

Most cases contain a single written opinion that constitutes the court’s decision, but appellate cases are usually decided by more than one judge. If there’s disagreement among them regarding the outcome or the reasoning there will be more than one opinion written. If there's more than one opinion, one of these is controlling.

- The **majority opinion** is always the one that more than half of the judges deciding the case have signed onto. When a majority opinion exists, it is controlling and constitutes the law. The majority opinion will appear before any other opinions included in the case document.
- **Concurring opinions** agree with the outcome of a case, but they do so for different reasons. When there is a majority opinion in a case, the concurring opinion cannot be considered mandatory because the rationale of a concurring opinion differs in some way from the majority. However, a concurring opinion can sometimes be considered to hold mandatory authority when no opinion has the support of a majority of the judges.
- **Plurality opinions** exist in cases where the majority of judges agree on the outcome of the case but no opinion has the support of the majority. In other words, although a majority of judges concur in the outcome, they don’t agree on the reasons for it. *In this situation, the opinion in favor of the winning party that has the most support among the judges is the plurality opinion.* However, the plurality opinion is not automatically the controlling one. The U.S. Supreme Court stated in Marks v. United States that when no opinion has the support of the majority, the controlling opinion will be the one that decided the issue on the narrowest grounds. TWhere there is no majority opinion, a concurring opinion could be considered controlling if it fits the Supreme Court’s criteria better than the plurality opinion. Interpreting this rule has created some confusion in later cases; *when there is no majority opinion in a case I want to use I will have to do additional research to determine whether the plurality or a concurring opinion is controlling.*
- **Dissenting opinions** are never considered mandatory as they disagree with the outcome of the case, either in whole or in part. However, sometimes a dissent proposes changes in the law or contains an insightful analysis that can be used persuasively in later cases to challenge established precedent.

## 4. Updating Legal Sources

Update sources to make sure the law is still current. Determine whether each source reflects the current status of the law and which sources can no longer be relied on or should only be used with caution.

**D. The Federal Court System**

1. Trial Courts are called the United States District Courts. 94 Federal district courts; at least one in every state as well as the District of Columbia and in certain United States Territories. In more populous states there are several Federal district courts covering different geographic regions.
2. Intermediate-Level Courts: intermediate-level appellate courts are divided into separate circuits. In the Federal system, the district courts located in each circuit are only bound to follow the decisions of the U.S. Supreme Court and the Circuit Court of Appeals for their particular circuit. For example, Federal district courts in New York appeal to the 2d Circuit Court of Appeals, so decisions from that higher court are binding on them. However, Federal district courts in New York are not bound by decisions of the 11th Circuit Court of Appeals or any other circuit court besides the 2d.

## Secondary sources

Squishy words:

- It depends
- likely
- unlikely

First place we all go is Google. (I got term "warrrabtt if habitability")

Second place we go to is the library

Westlaw Edge - Library

Go to secondary sources in the first placce and see whhat on shelf

Seccondary sources > new york > topic > real property

only 17 things on the shelf. It's a shelf of books. Tricky thiing is we don't know how biig those books are. Some might be multivolume. We open one of the books and get an elecctronic table of contents. Found chapter on warranty of habitability. Found lots of secctions in this chapter. Found "rent abatement." Back to shelf. After some browsing I get to a statute. I always want to go to the annotated version of the statute.

Reading secondary sources take us to statutes which ttake us to cases which take us back to secondary sources andd around and around.

Wrong way: random terms. Dive into the first case Westlaw turns up. Dive into other cases. Go down a rabbit hole.

## Types of secondary sources

Something and "Commentary"

- Treatises // Practitioner Sources
- Encyclopedias
- Law Review Articles

Encyclopedias provide an overview of the area of the law and may contain citations to some ccases and statutes. NOT where you go for very up-to-date information Amerrican jurispudence is the national one - very broad - new york jurisprudence is a little less broad and updated a little more frequently; still very general. Good but not greatt. What I really want is a treatise. A treatise provides in-deptth diiscussion on a particular legal topic anddd is often writtten by legal scholars. Practitionerr sourcces are a little more specific in tterms of what ccan be useful tto a pracctitiioner. In depth analysis of particular area of law wiith citations to cases, statutes, regulaattions; practiccal suggestions and tips (love tips); forms

ALR: American Law Reports (another beast)

Westlaw gives you suggestions (if you like this you might also like this). Westlaw often suggests ALR. ALR is often very good for very specific issues. Lots of citations. But, just like with encyclopedias, ALR is not always up to date.

Law Review articles

When I'm doing research on a specific topic I should filter these out because they're largely academic. Professors critiquing the law and saying what it should be. Law reviews are usually structured similarly. Section two is usually background and therefore useful. When new or changing topic can be useful. Law Review articcles can be useful forr classes where you are writing about a theorrettical topic. Problem in thhose clsses is often people don't do much research. Law Review articles are good for this. Westlaw and Lexis are good to find recent law review articles. Only go back to thhe 90s. For older law review articcles use HEIN Online.

**HEIN Online**

Nice obsession with footnotes. HEIN is mostly PDFs so footnotes are in bottom of page.

Is failing to register as a sex offender a strict liabiility crime

Assignment 2 highlights after the fact

- we used a more formed issue
- choosing jurisdiction is crucial
- these are the types we see:
- 1. book by Judge Bogle (treatise) (good, I want this) (I go to cases in book and see what courts are - whether persuasive)
- 2. What is this? Pretty broad - a treatise - charges to the jury (may not be super updated)
- 3. ALR (seems to be highly relevant, and it is; the tricky thing with ALR is that they apply to all states; they're doing a whole survey; but you can filter by state in the sidebar; when we do this here we don't really find pertinent results in New York)
- 5. New York Jurisprudence (this is a bit misleading but it's really good; takes us to People v. Haddock)
- 6. Boston Law Review (law reviews are tricky because theoretical and often broad in scope; here the question of constitutionality can be pertinent)
- 9. Cites People v. Haddock again. Also cites People v. Pattterson and the other.

Go into McKinney's law - go to toc - toc is the "statutory scheme"

We might want to go here to find specific words and to put what we're looking at the statutory scheme.

Go to notes of decision to find annotations by lawyers  

Go to citing references to see everywhere in the whole system in Westlaw where it is cited. Beautiful thing.

Lexis+ does this too. In Lexis+ it's called shepherd.

We want to admit that the algorithm in Westlaw and Lexis+ has improved tremendously over the years.

I can peek at cases.

Then, circle back to our discussion on first day of class. Pizza box.

Court of Appeals

| 1st Dep | 2nd Dep | 3rd Dep | 4th Dep |

| Patterson, Manson (not persuasive) | | People v. Haddock Court of appeals | |

This goes back to Mountain View. There is some authority that if my department hasn't talked but another department has that a court of appeals decision in another department is authoritative and 1st Department should be mandatory authority for the 3rd Department.

Rule 1: go to the library (secondary sources)

Rule 0.25: pen and paper

Rule 0.5: what is the deliverable? (lawyers are in the delivery business) (the only thing worse than turning up with a 40-page memo when all they wanted was a brief email is turning up with a brief summary when they wanted a 40-page memo)

Rule 0.75: where should I begin?

Look again at the legal research mini-playbook

STATUTORY RESEARCH

Most research is statutory

legislative history saved my ass

If statute involved in research, locate it first and use annotated statutte

annottations to relevant case law, secondary sourcces, ccross references etttc. are "pure gold"

---

The Legislative Process

- statutes are firstt proposed as bills in the legislature
- bills must pass through an involved legislative process bbefoe bbecocming statutes - most bills directly
- more stuff - see slides

On the Federal side when a bill makes it it beccomes public law. On state side when a bill maakes it it becomes chapter law

federal laws

bills become slip laws (assiigned "public law" numbers)

collection of slip laws ffor a particuclar ocngress = sessiion laws. cchronological = these are statutes at large

session laws compiled into a subjectt area arrangement are then known as a code

bills > publicc law > code

end of statutory text in code will give you PL number andd cite to statutes at large

all subsequent entries are amendments

UNITED STATES CODE ARRANGEMENT

U.S. Code is arranged by "titles"

Each title covers a speciffic area of law

examples: title 8: immigration ...

List of U.S. Code Titles (see slide)

New York Statutes

like federal law in process, but different names
sessiion laws are called "chapters"

codified into McKinney's/CLS

Citation at the end of the statutory text: L. 1999, c. 255 = Legislative year/session 1999; 255th law passed

New York Statues (list in slides) - law in NY organiized by area of law

Hard copy publication sourcces for statutes in Federal & NY systems

| 1. Slip Law | (see slide) |

**Finding statutes**

1. citation
2. popular name (sometimes practitioners refer to in a way)
3. cases/secondary sources
4. index
5. table of contents/statutory scheme
6. full text searching

---

Assignment 3

Experience looking at a statute and navigate one. Use Lexis.

enter statute

full text of statute > scroll down to History - see how many times amended - shepherds tells us there is pending legislation

Instead of tabs like Westlaw, Lexis has dropdowns

statutory scheme: pull out large section

Shepardize: takes you to another screen where all citations witthin Lexis system.

Look at text of statute; look around, get bearings, see what I see.
