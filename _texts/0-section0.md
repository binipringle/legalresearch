# Government power and the Law

- **statutes** are enacted by the legislative branch of government.
- **executive orders** and **Presidential proclamations** are issued by the executive branch of government (aka administrative branch).
- **regulations** are issued by specialized administrative agencies to implement policies and directives of Congress and the President.
- **cases** are decided by the judicial branch of government. Judicial opinions create law in areas not covered by statutes or regulations. Judge-created law is common law.

# Federal and State jurisdictions

- **Federal courts** have jurisdiction over any issue involving a federal statute, a treaty, or the U.S. Constitution.
- **State governments** control torts, contracts, family law and other cases.
- **Both federal and state laws** can apply to some areas such as environmental law, tax law, and labor law, sometimes giving the party initiating the lawsuit a choice of whether to file the case in a Federal or state court system.

# Understanding legal authority

Map: (1) U.S. Constitution > Art. 1 legislative branch (2) statutes / codes > Art. 2 executive branch (3) regulations > Art. 3 judicial branch (4) judicial branch - case law

## 1. Sources of authority

### a. Primary sources

- statutes
- regulations and decisions of administrative agencies
- executive orders and presidential proclamations
- court opinions written by the judiciary

### b. Secondary sources

- anything pertaining to the law that is not considered a primary source. Can be analysis of law, critique of law, explanation of legal strategy, legal practice tips and so on.

## 2. Weight of authority

In order for a law to be binding, **it must be considered mandatory authority in the jurisdiction where the case is brought.**

### a. Mandatory authority

- statutes
- administrative law
- cases

*ideal* case law:

mandatory precedent

<p style="margin-left:10%; margin-right:10%;">with similar facts</p>

<p style="margin-left:15%; margin-right:10%;">that is still good law</p>

<p style="margin-left:20%; margin-right:10%;">with good legal reasoning</p>

<p style="margin-left:25%; margin-right:10%;">that is often cited</p>

<p style="margin-left:30%; margin-right:10%;">and is relatively recent.</p>

### b. Persuasive authority

Courts have discretion to consider non-mandatory primary and secondary sources as persuasive authority. Sometimes primary law sources from another jurisdiction can be used persuasively. Secondary sources can sometimes be used persuasively too. Both can play a role in situations such as:

- convincing a court how the law should be applied to particular facts;
- challenging how laws have been applied in the past;
- cases involving areas of law that are unsettled in a jurisdiction but may have been decided elsewhere; and
- challenging the validity of the laws themselves.

## 3. Case authority - additional considerations

### a. Precedent: stare decisis

- deciding cases in accordance with established precedent lends predictability and stability to the law and society, and provides some degree of confidence that legal disputes will be handled fairly by the courts.

### b. Court system structure

The court system in a given jurisdiction affects which cases will hold mandatory authority. **Usually three-tiered structure:**

- Trial courts
- Intermediate-level appellate courts
- Final appellate courts

### c. Cases - which parts are considered binding

Only the text in the opinion contains the law. Sometimes more than one opinion is included in published cases and their precedential value is not equal.

### i. Holding versus Dictum

- The “holding” is the part of the opinion that bears directly on the issue at hand and is considered the law.
- “ratio decidendi” is when the court explains its reasoning in arriving at its holding. **This is also considered mandatory authority.**
- “Dictum” is any statement contained in a case opinion that doesn’t relate directly to the issue at hand or speculates about other situations or facts not present in the current case. *Dictum contained in an opinion is not mandatory, even though the other parts of the opinion that do pertain to the issue are mandatory.*

### ii. Majority, Concurring, Plurality, and Dissenting Opinions

Most cases contain a single written opinion that constitutes the court’s decision, but appellate cases are usually decided by more than one judge. **If there's more than one opinion, one of these is controlling.**

- **Majority opinion** - more than half of the judges deciding the case have signed onto. **When a majority opinion exists, it is controlling and constitutes the law.** The majority opinion appears first.
- **Concurring opinions** agree with the outcome of a case, but for different reasons. **When there is a majority opinion in a case, the concurring opinion cannot be considered mandatory** because the rationale of a concurring opinion differs in some way from the majority. However, *a concurring opinion can sometimes be considered to hold mandatory authority* when no opinion has the support of a majority of the judges.
- **Plurality opinions** exist in cases where the majority of judges agree on the outcome of the case but no opinion has the support of the majority. In other words, although a majority of judges concur in the outcome, they don’t agree on the reasons for it. In this situation, the opinion in favor of the winning party that has the most support among the judges is the plurality opinion. However, **the plurality opinion is not automatically the controlling one.** The U.S. Supreme Court stated in *Marks v. United States* that when no opinion has the support of the majority, the controlling opinion will be the one that decided the issue on the narrowest grounds. Where there is no majority opinion, a concurring opinion could be considered controlling if it fits the Supreme Court’s criteria better than the plurality opinion. Interpreting this rule has created some confusion in later cases; *when there is no majority opinion in a case I want to use I will have to do additional research to determine whether the plurality or a concurring opinion is controlling.*
- **Dissenting opinions** are **never considered mandatory** as they disagree with the outcome of the case, either in whole or in part. However, sometimes a dissent proposes changes in the law or contains an insightful analysis that can be used persuasively in later cases to challenge established precedent.

## 4. Updating Legal Sources

Determine whether each source reflects the current status of the law and which sources can no longer be relied on or should only be used with caution.

### D. The Federal Court System

- **U.S. Supreme Court**
- **1st, 2nd, 3rd, ... 11th + D.C. & Federal Circuit Courts of Appeals (13)** are intermediate-level appellate courts. They are divided into separate circuits.
- **U.S. District Courts (94)** are trial courts. At least one in every state (more in more populous states), some in District of Columbia and certain U.S. Territories. *District courts located in each circuit are only bound to follow the decisions of the U.S. Supreme Court and the Circuit Court of Appeals for their particular circuit.* For example, Federal district courts in New York appeal to the 2d Circuit Court of Appeals, so *decisions from the 2d Circuit Court of Appeals are binding on Federal district courts in New York*. However, Federal district courts in New York are not bound by decisions of the 11th Circuit Court of Appeals or any other circuit court besides the 2d. For example, decisions of the Federal Circuit Court of Appeals 1st Circuit are mandatory authority for District Courts in the 1st Circuit, but not for District Courts in any other circuit.

### E. The New York State Legal System and Sources of Law

1. **Legislative branch:** Senate and Assembly. Legislation passed by both chambers and not vetoed by governor becomes part of the NYS statutes.
2. **Executive branch:** Governor presiding over administrative agencies (usually created by the legislature) which create and enforce New York state regulations.
3. **Judicial branch:**

### a. Court System Structure

Differs from the federal system in important ways, such as different types of trial courts,  civil and criminal court systems.

- **New York Court of Appeals**
- **Appellate Divisions - 1st, 2nd 3rd, 4th Departments**
- **New York Supreme Courts (trial courts)**

The highest court in New York is the **New York Court of Appeals.**

Intermediate-Appellate Courts are **N.Y. Supreme Court, Appellate Division** is referred to as the **Appellate Division** and is divided into **four geographic departments.**

Trial courts are much more complicated than in the federal system. N.Y. Family Court, N.Y. Surrogate's Court, N.Y. Supreme Court *and others.* Other minor courts in certain counties. **N.Y. state trial level courts have no binding authority on each other.**

#### New York State Jurisdictional Subdivisions

*Counties also grouped by state Judicial District number because some NY trial courts use that jurisdictional designation rather than a county. Not to be confused with the Appellate Department number.*

Department | District | Counties |
First | 1st JD | New York |
--^^-- | 12th JD | Bronx |
Second | 2nd JD | Kings |
--^^-- | 9th JD | Dutchess, Orange, Putnam, Rockland, Westchester |
--^^-- | 10th JD | Nassau and Suffolk |
--^^-- | 11th JD | Queens |
--^^-- | 13th JD | Richmond (Staten Island) |
Third | 3rd JD | Albany, Columbia, Greene, Rensselaer, Schoharie, Sullivan, Ulster |
--^^-- | 4th JD | Clinton, Essex, Franklin, Fulton, Hamilton, Montgomery, St. Lawrence, Saratoga, Schenectady, Warren, Washington |
--^^-- | 6th JD | Broome, Chemung, Chenango, Cortland, Delaware, Madison, Otsego, Shuyler, Tioga, Tompkins |
Fourth | 5th JD | Herkimer, Jefferson, Lewis, Oneida, Onondaga, Oswego |
--^^-- | 7th JD | Cayuga, Livingston, Monroe, Ontario, Seneca, Steuben, Wayne, Yates |
--^^-- | 8th JD | Allegany, Cattaraugus, Chautaqua, Erie, Genesee, Niagara, Orleans, Wyoming |

### b. Authority in New York State Courts

In New York, the Appellate Division is split into four departments, but there is disagreement about whether decisions of one department’s Appellate Division court are binding on trial courts in other departments. In *Mountain View Coach Lines, Inc. v. Storms*, 102 A.D.2d 663 (2d Dep’t 1984), the second department Appellate Division court stated that the Appellate Division is one court divided into departments only for administrative convenience, and held that **decisions coming from any Appellate Division department are binding on all state trial courts in New York, as long as there is not a contrary ruling by the Appellate Division court in their own departments**. The Mountain View decision is still considered good law
in the Second Department and continues to be cited as authority and followed.

Some trial courts in the First Department have not followed Mountain View and view the Appellate Division Departments as separate courts, similar to the Federal Circuit Courts of Appeals. There has been no explicit ruling on the matter by the New York Court of Appeals to resolve this inconsistency.

New York appellate court decisions trial courts in New York will consider binding authority:

- Decisions from the Appellate Division court in your department are always
considered mandatory; additionally,
- For trial courts in the Second Department, decisions from Appellate Division
courts in other departments are mandatory as long as they are not in conflict with
decisions from the Appellate Division court in the second department;
- For trial courts in the First Department, decisions from Appellate Division courts
in other departments are not mandatory, but will be considered strongly
persuasive as long as they are not in conflict with decisions from the Appellate
Division court in the First Department;
- For trial courts in the Third and Fourth Departments, if you want to argue that an
Appellate Division decision from a different department is mandatory you will
need to do some additional research to see under what circumstances, if any,
Mountain View has been followed or distinguished by courts those departments.

# The Legal Research Plan

1. Organize facts and frame the issue
- a. use 5 Ws - who, what, where, when, why - to organize facts
- b. draft a preliminary issue statement
2. Jurisdiction
- identify jurisdiction
- know which sources are mandatory authority

# Secondary sources

Squishy words:

- It depends
- likely
- unlikely

First place we all go is Google to get terms (I got term "warranty of habitability"). Second place we go to is the library (for example, Westlaw Edge). There, go to secondary sources and see what on shelf *When searching remember to filter by jurisdiction>*

See [mini-playbook](https://binipringle.github.io/legalresearch/texts/2-section2/) for method of research.

Wrong way: random terms > dive into first case Westlaw returns > dive into other cases > down rabbit hole.

## Types of secondary sources

Something and "Commentary"

- Restatements
- Treatises / Practitioner Sources
- Encyclopedias
- Law Review Articles

Encyclopedias provide an overview of the area of the law and may contain citations to some cases and statutes. NOT where you go for very up-to-date information. *American Jurisprudence* is the national one - very broad. New York Jurisprudence is a little less broad and updated a little more frequently; still very general. Good but not great.

A treatise is what I really want. A treatise provides in-depth discussion on a particular legal topic and is often written by legal scholars.

Practitioner sources are a little more specific in terms of what can be useful to a practitioner. In-depth analysis of particular area of law with citations to cases, statutes, regulations; practical suggestions and tips (love tips); forms

American Law Reports (ALR)(another beast). Westlaw gives you suggestions (if you like this you might also like this). Westlaw often suggests ALR. ALR is often very good for very specific issues. Lots of citations. But, just like with encyclopedias, ALR is not always up to date.

Law Review articles are largely academic. Professors critiquing the law and saying what it should be. Law reviews are usually structured similarly. **Section two is usually background and therefore useful.** When new or changing topic can be useful. Law Review articles can be useful for classes where you are writing about a theoretical topic. Problem in those classes is often people don't do much research. Law Review articles are good for this. Westlaw and Lexis are good to find recent law review articles. Only go back to the 90s. For older law review articles use HEIN Online.

**HEIN Online** Nice obsession with footnotes. HEIN is mostly PDFs so footnotes are in bottom of page.

Assignment 2 highlights after the fact (is failing to register as a sex offender a strict liability crime)

- we used a more formed issue
- choosing jurisdiction is crucial
- these are the types we see:
- (1) book by Judge Bogle (treatise) (good, I want this) (I go to cases in book and see what courts are - whether persuasive)
- (2) What is this? Pretty broad - a treatise - charges to the jury (may not be super updated)
- (3) ALR (seems to be highly relevant, and it is; the tricky thing with ALR is that they apply to all states; they're doing a whole survey; but you can filter by state in the sidebar; when we do this here we don't really find pertinent results in New York)
- (5) New York Jurisprudence (this is a bit misleading but it's really good; takes us to People v. Haddock)
- (6) Boston Law Review (law reviews are tricky because theoretical and often broad in scope; here the question of constitutionality can be pertinent)
- (9) Cites People v. Haddock again. Also cites People v. Patterson and the other.

1. Go into McKinney's law - go to table of contents (toc) - toc is the "statutory scheme"
2. We might want to go here to find specific words and to put what we're looking at the statutory scheme.
3. Go to notes of decision to find annotations by lawyers  
4. Go to citing references to see everywhere in the whole system in Westlaw where it is cited. Beautiful thing.
5. Lexis+ does this too. In Lexis+ it's called shepherd.
6. We want to admit that the algorithm in Westlaw and Lexis+ has improved tremendously over the years.
7. I can peek at cases.
8. Then, circle back to our discussion on first day of class. **Pizza box.**

### N.Y. Court of Appeals

1st Dep | 2nd Dep | 3rd Dep | 4th Dep |
Patterson, Manson (not persuasive) | ------- | People v. Haddock Court of appeals | ------- |

This goes back to Mountain View. There is some authority that if my department hasn't talked but another department has that a court of appeals decision in another department is authoritative and 1st Department should be mandatory authority for the 3rd Department.

1. Rule 1: go to the library (secondary sources)
2. Rule 0.25: pen and paper
3. Rule 0.5: what is the deliverable? (lawyers are in the delivery business)
4. Rule 0.75: where should I begin?

Look again at the legal research [Mini Playbook](http://www.alr.legalresearch.nyc/playbook.pdf)

# Statutory Research

Most research is statutory. If statute involved in research, locate it first and **use annotated statute**. Annotations to relevant case law, secondary sources, cross references etc. are "pure gold."

---

## The Legislative Process

- Statutes are first proposed as bills in the legislature.
- Bills must pass through an involved legislative process before becoming statutes - most bills never make it.
- In this process, many documents may be generated. These become part of the bill's legislative history.
- These documents can include committee reports, hearings, the *Congressional Record* (reported debates and floor action), amended versions of bill, related bills.  

On the Federal side when a bill makes it, the bill becomes public law. On the state side, when a bill makes it, the bill becomes chapter law.

---

### Federal laws

- Bills become slip laws (assigned "public law" numbers)

- Collection of slip laws for a particular congress are **session laws**
- **Session laws** go in *chronological order* and are collected in **Statutes at Large (Stat.)**
- **Statutes at Large (Stat.)** are collections of **session laws.**
- **Session laws** compiled into a *subject area arrangement* are a **code*

**Bills > Public Laws (P.L.) > Code** (end of statutory text in code will give you P.L. number and cite to *Statutes at Large*)

**All subsequent entries are amendments** e.g. [STATUTORY TEXT would be here then at the bottom:]Pub. L. 103-322, 109 Stat. 1959, Pub. L. 104-294,110 Stat. 3506, Pub. L. 107-273, 116 Stat. 1806. (Here the original law was Public Law 103-322 meaning it was the 322nd law passed by the 103rd Congress and it can be found at volume 109 of the Statutes at Large beginning on page 1959, then an amendment was passed that was Public Law 104-294, which lives at volume  110 of the Statutes at Large beginning on page 3506, etc.)

---

## United States Code Arrangement

- U.S. Code is arranged by "titles"
- Each title covers a specific area of law
- Examples:
- Title 8 = Aliens and Nationality
- Title 28 = Judiciary and Judicial Procedure
- Title 42 = The Public Health and Welfare

---

## New York Statutes

- Like federal law in process but different names
- Session laws are called **"chapters"** > codified into **McKinney's/CLS**
- Citation at the end of the statutory text: L. 1999, c. 255 (legislative year/session 1999; 255th law passed)   

Law in New York organized by area of law

### Hard copy publication sources for statutes in Federal & N.Y. systems

--------- | Federal | New York |
(1) Slip Law | "Public Law" | "Chapter Law" |
(2) Session Law | U.S. Statutes at Large (Stat.) (official) | Laws of NY (L.) (official); McKinney's Session Laws (West); CLS Session Laws (Lexis) |
(3) Code | U.S.C. (official); USCA (West); USCS (Lexis) | No "official" code; McKinney's (West); CLS (Lexis) |

---

**Finding statutes**

1. citation
2. popular name (sometimes practitioners refer to in a way)
3. cases/secondary sources
4. index
5. table of contents/statutory scheme
6. full text searching

---

Assignment 3

Experience looking at a statute and navigate one. Use Lexis.

enter statute

full text of statute > scroll down to History - see how many times amended - shepherds tells us there is pending legislation

Instead of tabs like Westlaw, Lexis has dropdowns

statutory scheme: pull out large section

Shepardize: takes you to another screen where all citations witthin Lexis system.

Look at text of statute; look around, get bearings, see what I see.
