  DH in Prison is a capstone/thesis for the Master of Arts in Digital Humanities at the Graduate Center of the City University of New York, deposited May 2020. My thesis (on this site) discusses the need for including digital humanities courses in college-in-prison programs, and outlines how minimal computing methods can be used to offer incarcerated students an introductory digital humanities course and teach them the necessary technical skills. My capstone (on the other site) is a proof of concept for the course itself. Both sites were built with <a href="http://elotroalex.github.io/ed//">Ed.</a>, a <a href="https://jekyllrb.com/">Jekyll</a> theme based on <a href="http://go-dh.github.io/mincomp/">minimal computing principles</a>, and focused on legibility, durability, ease and flexibility.
