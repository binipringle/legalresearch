<h2 id="acknowledgments">Acknowledgments</h2>

<p>Like many digital humanities projects, <strong>DH in Prison/Intro to DH</strong> is built upon and informed by community work. I am strongly indebted to the CUNY Graduate Center <a href="https://www.gc.cuny.edu/Page-Elements/Academics-Research-Centers-Initiatives/Masters-Programs/Digital-Humanities">Digital Humanities Program</a> for providing a real community and for facilitating many formal and informal gatherings, workshops, academic events and conversations that informed and nourished my work.</p>

<p>I am deeply grateful to my thesis advisor Matthew K. Gold who inspired me, encouraged me, helped me sharpen, develop and scope my ideas, bore with me and supported me along the way. I am also deeply grateful to Patrick Smyth for his encouragement and support (Patrick told me back in 2018 that this project “has legs,” which, coming from Patrick, meant a great deal to me) and for kindling in me, through his awesome pedagogy, a real love for coding and exploring the affordances of digital tools for doing meaningful humanities work. I want to express my heartfelt gratitude to all the <a href="https://digitalfellows.commons.gc.cuny.edu/">GC Digital Fellows</a> who welcomed me weekly in their office hours, helped me when I got stuck, taught me in their workshops and always generously shared their expertise. Particular thanks to Javier Otero Peña, Olivia Ildefonso, Filipa Calado and Rafael Davis Portelo. I want to thank Lisa Marie Rhody for her encouragement and advice and for organizing the GC DHRI, which is a model that guides this project in many ways. I am grateful to Alex Gil, Marii Nyröp and the <a href="http://www.globaloutlookdh.org/">Global Outlook::Digital Humanities</a> for their work and conversations which inspired, informed and guided mine, and specifically to Alex for the <a href="https://elotroalex.github.io/ed/">Ed.</a> Jekyll theme and for its excellent documentation.</p>

<p>I also want to extend my sincere thanks to my fellow student and friend Carolyn McDonough, who listened to me, gave me lots of ideas, supported me and shared much-needed comic relief in our conversations about a fictitious “valve therapy” treatment to decompress when the rigors of academic work required a break. I want to thank Irma Ostroff and Lance Jay Brown for looking at endless iterations of this project, sharing my enthusiasm, and encouraging and listening to me. I am grateful to Olga Dais for her continued support and encouragement, and to Lisa Hochstadt for her ongoing encouragement and support and for helping me prepare my lightning talk. Sincere thanks to Carla Cappetti, Joshua Wilner and Barbara Gleason for teaching me a lot of what went into this thesis, and to Ilian David Sanchez Rodriguez and Gisella Lopez Bautista for their support and for jumping in with their awesome art work.</p>

<p>Last but not least, I want to thank the students I tutored at Metropolitan Detention Center Brooklyn for helping me manifest my concept, and to understand some of the things that they would need to help them learn if a <strong>DH in Prison/Intro to DH</strong> or similar course were made available to them.</p>
