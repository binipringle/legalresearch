  content: "With the aim of extending academic opportunities to system-impacted students, this paper explores ways to develop an undergraduate college-level course in digital humanities to be taught in prison. So far, there have been only a few digital humanities projects in prisons in the U.S.. This is partly because restrictions on the use of electronic devices make digital resources mostly unavailable to incarcerated students. In view of these existing restrictions, the course envisioned here relies on minimal computing solutions to work under a wide range of prison-specific constraints including hardware, software, connectivity, and the probability that some incarcerated students may not have all the technical skills they will need to take an undergraduate digital humanities course.\n\nThe course model included in this project adapts a series of tutorials developed by the Graduate Center Digital Fellows for the Graduate Center Digital Initiatives (GCDI) Digital Humanities Research Institute (GC DHRI), which cover basic technical skills students will need. The model course is designed to be housed on a static site and delivered in a regular classroom equipped with seventeen laptops connected by a local area network. No internet connection is needed. Students will use the laptops to explore the field of digital humanities and engage in DH praxis as they gain expertise in technical skills as well as tools and methods for humanities research. The dual purposes of this pedagogical initiative are, on one hand, to provide students with tools to engage in humanities scholarship and, on the other hand, to learn digital skills which will help them find employment upon release. The technical part of the course covers the command line, version control, HTML and CSS, Jekyll (Ruby) and Python.\n\nThe solutions sought in this paper are influenced and inspired by conversations, praxis and ideas that grew out of the field of minimal computing. As such, the envisioned DH in prison course aims to fulfill student needs at minimal cost, keeping in mind monetary cost, cost in labor, learning curves, environmental impact, and independence. A case study and possible proposal to teach this course in the John Jay College of Criminal Justice Prison-to-College Pipeline program at Otisville Correctional Facility is included in chapter five.\n",

  content: "The United States has the highest incarceration rate in the world with around 2.2 million adults in prisons and jails and more than 4.5 million adults on probation or parole (Kaeble). In addition to these, 60,000 people under the age of 18 are being held in juvenile detention centers on any given day (American Civil Liberties Union). There are 5.6 times more black or brown people in prison than white people per 100,000 of the population (Carson). Native Americans, lesbians, gays, bisexuals, transgender and gender nonconforming individuals go to jail or prison two to four times more than heterosexual whites (Hartney). A University of Georgia study published in 2017 shows that at least 19 million adults, representing 8% of the overall U.S. population and 33% of the African American male population, have felony convictions; shockingly, only 3% of the total U.S. population but 15% of the African American male population have served time in prison (Shannon). All formerly incarcerated people face serious difficulties in finding employment when they are released, and the toll on low income black and brown communities has been devastating. Nicholas Turner, Director of the Vera Institute of Justice, observes that\n\n\n  We have lost generations of young men and women, particularly young men of color, to long and brutal prison terms. Even when they return home, they remain lost, as deplorable prison conditions and treatment seriously impair their ability to live productive and healthy lives long after release1.\n\n\nDespite evidence that education programs in prison lower short-term recidivism by 43% and long-term recidivism by 29% (Davis), the passage of the Violent Crime Control Act and Law Enforcement Act of 1994 made all incarcerated students ineligible for financial aid. In this way the criminal justice system keeps hundreds of thousands of people out of school. Privately funded prison education programs work hard to provide students with courses that lead to certificates, associate’s, and bachelor’s degrees, as well as pre-college programs that prepare them for these. With so many people in jail and so few of them able to pursue an education, CUNY’s mission to serve “as a vehicle for the upward mobility of the disadvantaged in the City of New York” (“The CUNY Story”) must continue to extend to those behind bars.\n\nIn April 2020 The Institute for Justice and Opportunity at John Jay College (until recently named the Prisoner Reentry Institute)2 released a 60-page report on CUNY’s commitment to students impacted by the criminal justice system. In his foreword to this report, Vice Chancellor and University Provost José Luis Cruz invokes the need “to embrace our mission of access and inclusion by seeking and serving broader prospective student populations, especially those whom we have sometimes overlooked in the past,”  recognizing that “[o]ne our most overlooked populations is those students who have been incarcerated” (The Institute for Justice and Opportunity, “Report”).\n\nThrough the Prison-to-College Pipeline (P2CP), CUNY’s college-in-prison program based at Otisville Correctional Facility in upstate new York, a good number of incarcerated students are able to pursue higher education before release. Started by John Jay Professor Baz Draesinger, this program has been operating since 2011 and presents an inspirational model of how education can “tear down [the] walls [erected by the United States’ prejudiced and inequitable criminal legal system]” (The Institute for Justice and Opportunity, “Report”) and help restore lives. The P2CP has been one of the guiding lights of this project, and a possible proposal for developing the course outlined here for P2CP at Otisville is discussed in chapter five.\n\nMost correctional facilities are under-resourced and low-tech, and students are denied internet access. The scarcity of hard and soft infrastructure to support digital work in prison is an opportunity for innovation through adapting and developing tools for digital humanities praxis within the parameters of minimal computing. Such tools will also be easily exportable to prisons and other low-tech environments in the U.S. and in other parts of the world.\n\nWith a firm belief that education is a real means to help people improve their lives, this paper explores how a digital humanities course can be taught in prison and why the humanities, and not just technical skills, contribute to laying foundations for helping system-impacted people rebuild their lives and enriching the communities they return to after release.\n\n\n\n  \n    \n      Delaney et al., Reimagining Prison &#x21a9;&#xfe0e;\n    \n    \n      Founded in 2005, the Prisoner Reentry Institute was officially renamed the Institute for Justice and Opportunity in April 2020. &#x21a9;&#xfe0e;\n    \n  \n\n",

  title: "2. Education in Prison",
  author: null,
  layout: "narrative",
  content: "Background\n\nMass incarceration started in the 1970s with changes in federal and state legislation that severely limited judges’ power of discretion in sentencing. As a result, the number of adults incarcerated in prisons and jails in the U.S. grew from around 360,000 in 1981 (Bureau of Justice Statistics) to more than 2,200,000 in 2020 (American Civil Liberties Union, “Mass Incarceration”). At the same that incarcerations started to rise, federal funding for education began to decline. In 1994, federal and state funding for education were completely eliminated with The Violent Crime Control and Law Enforcement Act (Public Law 103-322), which amended the Higher Education Act of 1965 to the effect that no basic educational grant would be awarded to any individual incarcerated in any Federal or State penal institution. All incarcerated people, who come mostly from lower income households which rely on federal Pell Grants and the New York State Tuition Assistance Program (TAP) to pay for college, became ineligible for these as well as for other federal and state financial aid. With no funding, between 1990 and 1997 the number of prison college programs in the United States fell from 772 to 8 (Sawyer). Mass incarceration continued to rise. Prisons continued to grow.\n\nThe business model of the industrial-prison complex values security, cost effectiveness or – in privatized prisons - profit over educational goals. The failure to invest in educational programs is not an unfortunate choice or bureaucratic oversight, but a racist strategy with its roots in slavery and Jim Crow, openly embraced not only by the Republican Party, but also by Democrats, for it was the Clinton administration that escalated the war on drugs, giving birth to the penal system of mass incarceration and creating what Michelle Alexander calls “a permanent underclass […] that would leave millions of people, overwhelmingly people of color, permanently locked up or locked out” (Childress).\n\nThe Center for American Progress reports that nearly 75 percent of those in state prison and 60 percent of those in federal prison have no high school credential but only about a third of those without it successfully obtain one during their prison terms (Bender). This means that about 766,000 incarcerated adults do have the necessary certification to enroll in college. It is our duty as a society to give them the means to go to school and the support to achieve academic success.\n\nIn 2015 the Obama administration launched the Second Chance Pell Pilot Program, an experimental program that allowed 12,000 incarcerated students to receive Pell Grants at 681 selected prisons (Federal Register Doc. 2015-18994). The future of the Second Chance Pell program is always unsure because institutions have to reapply every year. It has a lot of support, however, and in 2019 congress pointed to its success as it proposed an amendment to the HEA that would reinstate federal financial aid for all academically eligible incarcerated people.   This amendment was not adopted. Instead, U.S. Education Secretary Betsy Devos announced an expansion of the Second Chance Pell program (which the current administration calls the Second Chance Pell “experiment”) in 2020-21 which more than doubles its size by adding 67 new postsecondary institutions throughout the U.S. (St Amour).\n\nIn 2018 Congress passed The First Step Act, a bipartisan criminal justice reform bill which provides $375 million in new funding for job training and education programs in federal prisons (First Step Act). The amount of funding that will go into federal prison college programs, however, is unknown; the bill privileges churches and “other outside groups” for access to funds (George). While all funding is a step in the right direction, the First Step Act benefits comparatively few students in prisons and jails because it is a Federal Bureau of Justice reform bill that affects only federal prisons, which hold only about 181,000 of the 2.2 million people currently incarcerated in the United States. The remaining two million people in state prisons, state detention centers and county jails do not benefit in any way from the First Step Act. Instead, these institutions continue to serve as vehicles to push racist reactionary policies designed to oppress and disenfranchise large segments of the population, and to reap huge profits from the prison-industrial complex as they do so.\n\n\n\nReducing Recidivism\n\nA landmark analysis of correctional education programs published by the RAND Corporation in 2013 covering 30 years of research shows that that prison-based education reduces short-term recidivism by 43% and long-term recidivism by 29% (Davis et al.). The same study shows that prison-based education lowers incarceration costs, yielding $4 to $5 of taxpayer savings for every dollar invested in helping incarcerated people learn (Davis et al.). The Vera Institute of Justice further observes that communities benefit over time, because “when parents, including incarcerated parents, complete college, their children are more likely to do so, thereby disrupting the typical cycle of poverty and incarceration” (“Fact Sheet”). It is thus in the interest of our communities and of our larger social fabric that we give people in prison the opportunity to acquire skills that will help them get jobs, which will in turn help underserved communities gain economic stability and move a little closer towards having some of the safety that privileges the middle class.\n\nIncarcerated people come predominantly from low income households. Only about 59% of people serving prison terms have high school diplomas, compared with about 82% of the general population, and only about 24% have attended college (Bender). Instead of providing these people with opportunities to enroll in postsecondary education programs, the criminal justice system continues to segregate the least fortunate and most vulnerable members of society in institutions which utterly fail to prepare them for life after release. And most people serving sentences in prison will be released. The main goal of prison should be to prepare them to be useful, productive and not unhappy members of the communities they return to or become part of upon release. In the words of Natasha White, a formerly incarcerated advocate and a leader in in the #CLOSErikers and #buildCOMMUNITIES campaigns,\n\n\n  What we have now is a race- and poverty-based system, for punishing and oppressing, not rehabilitating black and brown people. What we need is more Assertive Community Treatment for mental health concerns, more re-entry support for people coming home from prison, and programs for youth whose parents are incarcerated or addicted, so they have no need to turn to the streets.\n\n\nThe prison-industrial complex attempts to dehumanize; humanities scholarship does the exact opposite. Because Digital Humanities uses technology for humanities research, it involves learning transferrable technical skills and is thus as a choice of study both healing and pragmatic, furthering system-impacted students’ intellectual and professional growth and making it statistically less likely that they will recidivate.\n\n\n\nThe Digital Divide\n\nMost prison courses are book-based and most writing is done by hand. Facilities are under-resourced and low-tech, and students are denied internet access. In normal conditions, some incarcerated people who can afford to pay for email services do have limited access to web-based technology. Federal prisons give some incarcerated people access to an email service called Corrlinks, for an exorbitant fee. Some prison libraries have computer rooms where incarcerated people can research their cases and read other cases that the BOP chooses to share. On these computers users can enter their passwords and connect directly to the BOP database that corresponds to their case. Many prisons also have computers for taking the GED but these computers belong to GED Testing LLC and are only ever used for taking the actual GED exam; all practice exams are paper-based. When incarcerated students take the GED, one of their biggest challenges is typing the extended response (a four to seven paragraph essay in 45 minutes) on a clunky computer. They can only prepare for this part of the exam through writing long hand, and many students fail that part of the exam the first time round because they are not able to adequately prepare.\n\nThe value of education in prison is clear. However, while the number of people in prison in the U.S. increased a staggering 700% from 1972 to 2010 (American Civil Liberties Union, “Mass Incarceration”), prison college programs fell by 98%. In 2015, only 35% of prisons reported offering college programs and these programs served only 6% of the total state prison population in the U.S. (Delaney et al.). Due to the lack of funding, prison-based education programs are extremely low-tech, and simply do not have the capacity to teach students computer skills. This is a huge problem in terms of student preparedness for the current job market which places tremendous value on digital competencies.\n\nTechnology changes fast. All students, not just those who wish to specialize in digital humanities or work in tech, need training in digital skills. For them to be competitive job applicants when they leave prison they will need to know how to use digital technologies at work. They will also need to know how to use technology in their everyday lives. In writing for the Chronicle of Higher Education about the successful incorporation of digital technologies in a liberal arts curriculum at Bryn Mawr, Beckie Supiano argues that although today’s traditional-age students are digital natives, there is a difference between familiarity with digital technologies and understanding these, and while students may know how to find information online they do not necessarily know how to evaluate its trustworthiness. In this, prison populations are no different from the general population. However, time spent in prison places them at a huge disadvantage because during the time they are locked up they cannot keep up with changes in programs and software. Those who serve long prison terms will find that their basic user knowledge becomes obsolete. If they study digital humanities in prison, however, they will come to have an edge that a lot of people on the outside do not. As Supiano notes, “Growing up using apps doesn’t mean you know how to build one.” Learning how to build apps will give incarcerated students not only a critical and extensive knowledge of how programs work but will also make them super users of these and as a consequence, attractive to potential employers in the tech sector and beyond.\n\nThe current digital divide between prisons and free communities puts formerly incarcerated at a disadvantage not only in terms of jobs but in terms of knowledge that enables them to navigate a data-driven society that trades in information. This  stops them from civically engaging through digitally informed advocacy work in the public sphere. Because a large part of digital humanities is to question and critique digital systems and tools it uses, the study of digital humanities involves learning a lot of technical skills. These are useful in understanding not only the tools used in humanities research but also information systems and computer programs that underlie most of the infrastructures we depend on in our everyday lives.\n\n\n\nThe right to an education\n\nIn the United States, education is, arguably, not a right. While the U.S. constitution does not specifically recognize education as a civil right, two recent civil action suits brought to state and federal courts argue that the failure of public schools to teach students to read and write is in effect depriving them of their constitutional right to participate in democratic government.2 Some suits went further and argued that postsecondary education is a prerequisite for economic equality and should be available to all and free. Not providing all citizens with the means to participate fully in civic and economic spheres is a form of discrimination, the argument goes. This is a compelling argument and a basis for some of the protections encompassed in The International Covenant on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights (ICESCR), a multilateral treaty adopted by the United Nations General Assembly in 1966, which commits its parties to work toward ensuring the granting of a number of basic rights including the right to primary and postsecondary education. The inclusion of not only primary but also postsecondary education as a right is wonderfully radical. As of September 2018, the Covenant had 169 parties. A further four countries, including the United States, had signed but not ratified the Covenant (Wikipedia contributors, “International Covenant on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights”).\n\n\n\n  \n    \n      Since 2015 the number of institutions participating in the Second Chance Pell program went down from 68 to 64. &#x21a9;&#xfe0e;\n    \n    \n      Cook v. Raimondo (Rhode Island) and Gary B. v. Snyder (Michigan), both 2018. &#x21a9;&#xfe0e;\n    \n  \n\n",

  content: "College-in-prison programs in New York State\n\nAs of March 2019, there were 15 college-in-prison programs operating in 25 correctional facilities run by New York State; this is a great increase from four in the mid-1990s but a big decrease from the 1970s, when there were seventy higher education programs in prisons in New York State (Prisoner Reentry Institute).  The existing programs are funded by the Federal Second Chance Pell pilot program, the District Attorney of New York’s Criminal Justice Investment Initiative (DANY CJII), and the State Legislature. But despite the progress that has been made since the 1990s, only 3% of the approximately 47,000 individuals incarcerated in New York State are able to participate in college programs as of March 2019 (Prisoner Reentry institute).\n\nJohn Jay College of Criminal Justice, one of the senior colleges of the City University of New York and one of the premier criminal justice and liberal arts institutions in the United States, is fulfilling CUNY’s mission of providing education to the disadvantaged of the City of New York by making it possible for hundreds of incarcerated people to earn college degrees. Bard College, Columbia University, Hamilton College, Marymount Manhattan College and New York University are some of the colleges that are also providing college-in-prison programs in New York State. In some of these programs, students who have not yet earned their degrees are guaranteed a place in college when they are released.\n\nWe got a rare look into The Bard Prison Initiative last year through Lynn Novick and Ken Burns’s powerful documentary film College Between Bars (Novick). In this film, Novick follows twelve incarcerated men and women studying to earn college degrees while in prison, showing that it is no easy goal to achieve even with the funding and dedicated faculty Bard provides. The stories of these men and women inspire optimism and hope because we see them transform themselves and take control of their lives to such an extent that they become leaders for others, setting an example of how tremendously empowering higher education can be. Many of the courses taught at Bard are humanities courses. They are all paper based.\n\nDigital humanities courses were taught in prison as part of The Center for Justice at Columbia University’s Justice-in-Education Initiative (“JIE”) which offers credit-bearing college courses in the humanities and social sciences at Rikers Island, Taconic, Sing Sing and Bedford Hills (Justice-in-Education). The digital arts and humanities JIE offered starting in 2015 were mostly developed by Columbia’s Group for Experimental Methods in the Humanities, focused on social justice issues at Rikers Island and used minimal computing methods. These courses involved producing and recording songs with iPads, learning to code and producing a Twitter feed called Rikers Bot in an automated Twitter account (Rikers Bot), designing games, learning to build websites and develop aesthetic and technical skills in graphic design. Rikers Island is supposedly a short-term detention facility so the students in the digital humanities courses JIE took to Rikers were affected by this. We have a lot to learn from JIE’s work at Rikers.\n\nMarymount Manhattan College’s Bedford Hills College Program (BHCP) offers women incarcerated at Bedford Hills Correctional Facility credit-bearing courses leading to an Associates of Arts degree in Social Sciences and a Bachelor of Arts degree in Sociology. Bedford Hills has a networked computer lab without internet (Bedford Hills College Program). Based on my research, it does not offer courses in digital humanities.\nThe New York University Prison Education Program (NYU PEP) offers an Associate of Arts degree to men incarcerated at Wallkill Correctional Facility in Ulster County, New York. All their courses carry transferrable credits. Walkill has audiovisual technology in its classroom or classrooms and a computer lab (NYU Prison Education Program). Based on my research, NYU PEP does not offer digital humanities courses.\n\nThe Institute for Justice and Opportunity at CUNY’s John Jay College of Criminal Justice has a program called the Prison-to-College Pipeline (P2CP) which funnels students into college to complete degrees they start at Otisville Correctional Facility in upstate New York. P2CP students are incarcerated adults who have high school diplomas or GEDs, are sentenced to fewer than five years and pass CUNY reading and writing assessment tests. All students who maintain passing grades are guaranteed admission to a CUNY institution upon release (Prison-to-College Pipeline). P2CP’s academic program includes courses in Anthropology, English, Sociology and others. As far as I can tell, no digital humanities courses are currently taught at Otisville.\n\n\nPrograms and Initiatives in other states and other countries\n\nAt San Quentin State Prison in California a nonprofit startup education program called Last Mile is teaching incarcerated students to code. Founded by Chris Redlitz, a Californian venture capitalist, Last Mile’s stated mission is “to provide marketable skills that lead to employment” and secure incarcerated people jobs (Last Mile). Trainees are taught to code in HTML, JavaScript, CSS and Python without internet connectivity through a proprietary programming platform. In 2016, Redlitz launched TLMWorks, a web development shop inside San Quentin where incarcerated graduates work for what the Last Mile website claims is “an industry standard wage” (Last Mile) While I share Last Mile’s stated goal of arming incarcerated people with marketable skills that will lead to employment, I am a little wary of any company that makes a profit on labor done behind bars. In addition to this, Last Mile’s software is not open source and this I consider unkind. On the other hand, photographs show incarcerated coders working in a spacious room filled with desktops (Last Mile) and I imagine they are learning a lot.\n\nFinland and some other Scandinavian countries are using more and more technology in their successful prison reform programs, providing some incarcerated people with laptops and tablets that they can use in cells and libraries. The Scandinavian approach is rehabilitative and stands in stark contrast to the punitive approach to incarceration we find in the U.S.. And it works. Rates of incarceration, recidivism and prison violence in Scandinavian countries are the lowest in the world (Yukhnenko). According to British prison architect Roland Karthaus, this is due to a fundamental shift in how most people think about incarceration. “The Scandinavian mindset is that if someone is in prison, that’s our fault as a society,” he says. “We let you fall through the cracks, so it’s our responsibility to rehabilitate you.” In contrast, prisons in England not only aim to punish, but also want to be show taxpayers that they punish, with politicians constantly citing public opinion to justify draconian measures (Karthaus).\n\nThis year, at a prison in Turku, Finland, incarcerated people are taking a course in Artificial Intelligence which was originally designed at the University of Helsinki as a more accessible version of an Introduction to AI curriculum for computer science students. The AI in prison initiative was proposed by Pia Puolakka, a project manager at the Criminal Sanctions Agency, the governmental organization in charge of Finland’s prison system. Introduction to AI is a free course designed by Reaktor, the tech consultancy that helps distribute the course to incarcerated students in Turku. According to Sanjana Varghese from Wired, Reaktor is currently working on a system that would enable course-taking incarcerated people to receive university credits and take other courses. The Finnish government embraced the scheme as a way of supporting incarcerated people reintegrating into a digital-first employment market once they left prison (Varghese).\n\nMore and more initiatives for teaching technological and digital skills are starting to make their way into prisons around the world. In the U.S. it will take a long time for the broken systems of our chronically overcrowded prisons to catch up; they may only start to incorporate technology into their educational facilities when prison-industrial complex stakeholders see money to be made. Digital affordances in education will, however, continue to make their way to incarcerated students through the effort of dedicated faculty, staff, and administrators of educational initiatives in schools, colleges, universities and programs nation-wide.\n\n\n",

  title: "4. Prison constraints",
  author: null,
  layout: "narrative",
  content: "Technological Constraints\n\nOne of the reasons why technology is almost completely absent from United States prisons is that most incarcerated people and their families cannot afford to buy prison-approved devices or pay independent contractors’ exorbitant software service fees. The two companies that control most of the prison tech market – Advanced Technologies Group (AGT) and Securas Technologies – have a huge monopoly with little oversight and engage in predatory financial practices which include giving kickbacks to correctional facilities. Prisons exploit incarcerated people by profiting from their unregulated labor, paying them such abusively low wages that the MP3 players and tablets the prisons offer for sale are totally out of reach.\n\nThe big excuse for correctional facilities and their service providers’ tight control over tech is that digital communication between incarcerated people and the outside world is a potentially huge security risk. It is true that social media’s record as a means to organize and subvert makes it a dangerous tool in populations that have little to lose. The internet, however, can be controlled just as easily – even more easily – than traditional ways in which incarcerated people communicate with family, associates and friends. China, North Korea, Cuba, Venezuela, and the EU’s GDPR are all examples of controlled access to the internet. Security is not the issue here. The issue is money as a tool to disenfranchise, disempower, segregate and oppress, and to consolidate power control. Another proven way to segregate and oppress is to withhold education. It is therefore not surprising that teaching digital skills in prison-based educational programs is a low-priority goal. The excuse is that while allowing incarcerated people to use computers for educational purposes would be good, computers carry an inherent security risk. This risk is exaggerated and can easily be minimized.\n\n\n\nCommunication as a security threat\n\nAfter someone has been arrested and booked, they may be allowed, after having had their cell phone and other prohibited items confiscated, the proverbial one phone call. After that, they are plunged into a disorienting period of excommunication in a cell which usually has no windows and an electric light that always stays on, no clock in view, and no way of knowing how much time has passed except by counting the peanut butter and jelly sandwiches that might be breakfast and the moldy baloney or cheese sandwich that could be lunch or dinner. What the detainee could do with a cell phone at this point - maybe arrange an escape on the way to court or tell associates to destroy evidence – is not immediately clear.\n\nWhen the detainee has been put through the system and transferred from a court holding cell to a prison, communication with the outside world continues to be considered a security threat. Access to a phone might allow the incarcerated person to tamper with witnesses or direct others to conceal evidence, or, if the incarcerated person were engaged in organized crime, to direct criminal activities from prison, or provide information about the detention center facilities and staff which could be used to plan an escape, or arrange the entry of contraband.\n\nWhile the prohibition of unregulated cell phones makes sense as a security measure against potential violation of prison rules (“Contraband”), digital content can be easily monitored, and hardware can easily be locked into specific limited use. If incarcerated people were given limited internet access the demand for contraband cell phones, which sell for up to $2000 apiece (Roth), would surely go down. Prisons, however, are pushing the other way. In a statement accompanying proposed legislation for deploying new security measures to block cell phone use, Federal Communications Commission (FCC) Chairman Ajit Pai describes a gory catalog of crimes including hits and extorsion committed from prison with cell phones, stating that finding and removing cell phones is the most dangerous part of a correction officer’s job because “a prisoner will do almost anything to hide and keep a cellphone” (Lecher). Pai implies that all – or at least most - incarcerated people want cell phones for the purpose of committing violent crimes. However, the demand for contraband cell phones may well be driven more by people’s need to be in touch with families and friends than by intentions to carry out criminal activity through the use of cell phones, or by their need to procure a source of income.1  The idea that communication with people on the outside poses a security threat is true only if the communication is unmonitored. If digital services did not carry such prohibitive fees, incarcerated people could have a lot more controlled access to the communications systems than they do now, and prisons would have a lot less contraband.\n\n\n\nTech Monopolies\n\nState prisons have contracts with different telecommunications network providers such as Global Tel Link (GTL), which sells email service to incarcerated people. In 2015, GTL controlled 50% of the Inmate Calling Services $1.2 billion telecommunications industry (Wikipedia Contributors, “Global Tel Link”). In federal prisons incarcerated people can communicate with a limited number of pre-approved people by email using Corrlinks software provided by Advanced Technologies Group, L.L.C. (“Advanced Technologies Group”)2  which “develops and supports software solutions that help state and federal correctional agencies operate more efficiently” and preposterously claims that it “help[s] offenders become more self-reliant and better prepared to re-integrate into society.” Not only does it make money off people who have no choice but to purchase its wares, but also has the condescending gall to advertise its products as something that will help make them better people.\n\nCorrlinks is part of the Keefe Group, which in turn is part of the conglomerate H.I.G. Capital. It is a for-profit company subcontracted by prisons which charges incarcerated people and their families the rates that “the agency” sets (Corrlinks). From commissary to money transfer to communications to withholdings of up to 80% of incarcerated people’s wages, prisons and jails make enough money directly from incarcerated people and their families to fund a significant share of their operations. Therefore, incarcerated people are actually paying the salaries of corrections officers and prison administrators, many of whom without incarcerated people would be without jobs.\n\nAnother of the Keefe Group’s lucrative businesses whose margin of profit depends on having huge numbers of people behind bars is Access Securepak, which was an email provider for at least 18 state Departments of Corrections (DOC) in 2014 which, together with Keefe Commisary Network, reported net sales of more than $375 million in 2012 (Eldridge). In addition to electronics, Access Securepak sells food, clothing and personal hygiene products to incarcerated people in DOC facilities and county jails. The electronics available for purchase include televisions, radios, and headphones in clear plastic casings “to eliminate contraband” (“Catalog”).\n\nAnother company which makes a huge profit3 on prisons is JPay, a privately held corrections-related service provider holding contracts with state departments of correction, county jails and private federal prisons to provide email, money transfer, video visitation and parole and probation payments to approximately 1.5 million incarcerated people in 35 states. It was started by Ryan Shapiro in New York in 2002 and moved its headquarters to Miami in 2005. Ten years later JPay was bought by Securus Technologies, a prison communications firm that has been criticized for developing phone tracking technologies that can be used outside prisons and for charging very high rates for calls and pushing to mandate the removal of in-person meetings of incarcerated people with their families (Wagner and Jones). JPay was taken on by Senator Cory Booker in 2015 in a letter to the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau asking the agency to stop JPay’s predatory practices with prepaid debit cards (Lopez).\n\nThe prices of JPay’s digital offerings are outrageous too; but given that it has complete control over the prison markets it serves JPay is able to charge incarcerated people pretty much what it likes.  In 2009, JPay created an MP3 player for incarcerated people called the JP3 player, which sells in commissary for $39.99 (“Buying a JP3 Player”). Given that the wage for prison jobs for incarcerated people is between 86 cents and $3.45 per day (Sawyer), the JP3 player is unaffordable for most. The JP3 has a built-in radio, but songs have to be bought separately and cost on average $1.19 each, more than the average incarcerated person earns in a day. Songs available in the music library are selected by JPay and approved or censored by prison officials according to some criteria they do not disclose.\n\nIn 2012, JPay launched a tablet, the JP4, designed for the corrections industry, which enables incarcerated people to read and draft emails, play games, and listen to music. In 2015 the JP4 was replaced with the JP5mini, with a 4.3-inch screen and 16 GB storage, for $79.99 and the JP5S, with a 7-inch screen and 32 GB storage, for $129.99 (Battacharya). These prices are insane. According to CNN Business News, there were 60,000 JP4s in use in 2015 when the JP5 was launched (Battacharya). This is only about 4% of the approximately 1.5 million people JPay served at that time. This is no wonder, given how expensive they are.\n\nThe JP5 is not connected to the internet. Instead, it is run on the local JPay platform and is equipped with a secure bootloader on an Android operating system so no other operating system can be installed (Battacharya). These devices can be used to send and receive emails (there is a time lapse for screening) for the price of a 40 cent “stamp” (Battacharya). Users can also listen to music and audiobooks (which they have to buy), play games (which they have to buy) and watch movies (which they have to rent or buy). According to JPay, users can also access educational materials and read the daily news, but this depends on whether the prison makes these available. The JPay website does not specify if these services come with a fee. The only free features the JP5 tablet seems to have are a calculator and a stopwatch, and one maze game (“Buy Media”).\n\nRyan Shapiro, the company’s founder and CEO, stated that the company was “looking for products that an inmate would want to buy and a corrections facility would accept.” He went on to explain, as if it were the most natural thing in the world, that Jpay “take[s] outside applications, redevelop[s] them for prisons specifically, and then deploy[s] them […] the prison doesn’t pay for any of [their services]; it’s the end user who pays” (Lieber). And, as the JP4 was being launched, Shapiro was quoted saying, “Think about education, think about games; it’s endless where we could go. We think it’s as big, if not bigger, than the money-transfer business” (Lieber).  In a 2014 CNBC article, Ryan Shapiro stated “Our goal is to become the nation’s digital consumer app company for prisons” (Wikipedia Contributors, “JPay”).\n\nIn addition to communications and electronic devices for incarcerated people, JPay provides money transfer services  - it has a relationship with MoneyGram -, parole and probation payment services, a prepaid debit card for use upon release, and collects contributions for a charitable foundation founded by a former Texas warden to fund scholarships for children whose parents are incarcerated (Wikipedia Contributors, “JPay”). Given the prices JPay is charging, it is hard to see how people in prison would have much to donate.\n\nJPay was fined $80,000 in 2012 for violating Pennsylvania’s Money Transmitter Act by failing to have the necessary state license since it began operating in the state in 2004 and as of 2014, had been fined a total of $408,500 across seven states for operating unlicensed businesses (Wagner). In 2015, following a lawsuit by Valerie Buford against the Indiana Department of Corrections over revocation of her incarcerated brother’s access to communications networks, the Electronic Frontier Foundation criticized JPay for attempting to abuse copyright laws by stating in its terms and conditions that it owned all the content transmitted through its systems, after which JPay amended its terms of use (Maass). JPay gives a large part of its profits back to prisons in kickbacks or “commissions.” (Wagner). Although many of its contracts explicitly ban lobbying, JPay has hired state lobbyists and spent a lot of money lobbying in Washington to maintain its hold over the prison technology market (Wagner).\n\nLike sharks that smell blood, both big companies and smaller startups compete for their bite. Kolibri4  - an Application Programming Interface (“API”) which describes itself as “a collection of tools providing access to open-source learning resources ranging from literacy to chemical engineering” (Kolibri) caught my attention because it is a learning management system that works without the internet. It also caught the attention of JPay, which made KA Lite – the first instance of Kolibri - available to incarcerated people by installing it on JPay tablets “for free” in 2016 (“JPay proudly makes”). These tablets are used in classrooms in at least ten prisons in the U.S. through JPay Lantern, a partnership between JPay and Ashland University, a private Anabaptist University in Ohio, as part of an educational program self-described as “the largest digital education program in corrections” (JPay Lantern).\n\nI had no trouble downloading and installing the app and 10 GB of content in one hour in New York City in April, 2020 in the middle of the Covid-19 pandemic.5 I downloaded the Khan Academy “Arts and Humanities” and “Computing” resource collections and found that these contained only a small amount of extremely biased and dismally curated content. These are the resources thousands of incarcerated students are getting, funded through the scant resources for educational purposes bundled into the First Step Act. It is tremendously important that we push for oversight for funding real college programs instead of allowing funding to go towards dubious learning systems like Kolibri.\n\nAs technology use in education programs in prison increases, companies like Securus will be quick to snap up all the contracts and sell mediocre applications as educational tools. Instead of bridging the digital divide, such opportunism will simply litter the gap with e-waste.\n\n\n\nThe Digital-Analog Leap\n\nAware from first-hand experience of how important communication with family, friends and communities in the outside world is for those in prison, at least three formerly incarcerated people created Instagram-type apps which allow family and friends to send selfies and messages directly from their phones to the prisons, where these are printed out and delivered to incarcerated people as if they were mail. Pigeonly is an app that allows people on the outside to send photos and messages to people inside, as well as to access cheaper online phone rates for a low monthly fee (Pigeonly). Another app recently created by a formerly incarcerated person is Flikshop, an Instagram-type app that produces printable postcards “for as low as 0.79 cents” (Flikshop). A third app called InmateAid lets subscribers sidestep long-distance rates by facilitating an online connection at local phone rates regardless of geographical location for $8.95 a month, and has cut the calling costs for some families down from $750 a month to just $50 (Carville). “Many prisons welcome the new technology, viewing the start-ups as potential allies in the war against contraband [and are a] win-win for everybody,” says Tammy Moyer, the Lancaster County Prison in Pennsylvania Director of Administration (Carville).\n\n\n\nInternet\n\nThe extent to which at least some internet access is denied to most incarcerated people sets these apart from the general population and is an urgent concern. With visits from family, friends and advocates suspended during the Covid-19 pandemic, not having access to online communication is causing unnecessary suffering, and a lack of information has contributed to the exponential spread of Coronavirus in prisons and jails. While communication between free people in wealthier nations around the world has moved online, communication in prison is curtailed because prisons are completely locked down. Incarcerated people receive limited information about the virus itself, the only available sources being television, radio, prison authorities, corrections officers and some limited and expensive communication by phone. We cannot begin to imagine the emotional strain of being cut off from family and friends whose lives are at risk while within prisons the pandemic explodes.6\n\nThe New York State Department of Corrections and Community took some measures to increase access to electronic communications for incarcerated people including five free stamps per week, two free secure messages per week via electronic tablet and two free 30-minute phone calls (“Suspensions”). However, because lockdowns tend to limit movement within prisons it is not clear how easily incarcerated people can use their stamps, message vouchers and calls. Clampdowns on communication in prisons are thus contributing to a rising death toll and increasing levels of fear and stress in prison populations and making it difficult for advocates to know how bad things are on the inside.\n\n\n\nLearning constraints\n\nYears ago, my first boyfriend was incarcerated for something foolish he had done in his teens. His case had crawled through the criminal justice system for years, and when he was finally committed to prison, he was a happy, healthy young man with a job. When I went to visit him after only a week of confinement, however, I was struck by the change prison had wrought. His skin had lost its glow due to prison food, lack of fresh air and lack of exercise, and he was haggard on account of lost sleep.  The most striking change, though, was a sort of flitting absence that had taken hold in his eye. As we talked he was strangely distracted, as if he were not altogether there. As weeks and months went by these changes become more pronounced, and I saw that his sense of connection to the world was slipping away.\n\nA Prison Reform Trust report found that isolation from families and social networks, austere surroundings, loss of privacy, poor physical and hygienic conditions, aggression, bullying, fear, suspicion, the attitudes of unsympathetic and uninformed staff, lack of purposeful activity, loss of personal control, loss of power to act, loss of identity, pressure to escape or to take drugs, shame and stigmatization, uncertainty and concern about reentry all have severe negative effects on mental health (“Prisons can Seriously Damage your Mental Health”).  Under prison conditions, people shut down. Many turn to religion. Others seek solace in drugs. Prison is about as unconducive a learning environment as one can get.\n\nPrison schedules and regimens put incarcerated students under a lot of stress, which is never a good thing for study. Humanities courses are a good way to push back against the disassociation many imprisoned people experience when confined because the humanities help us situate personal experience in historical and systemic contexts, make connections between self and society, question, analyze, and imagine, thus engaging the mind. Learning to do humanities research through praxis with digital tools further helps people engage, even under duress, because it is fun. Fun is a proven pedagogical method to engage students. Building is empowering and building digital artifacts in collaboration with others will build student communities in the prison classroom.\n\n\n\n  \n    \n      Having a contraband cell phone in prison is a way to make money by allowing other incarcerated people to use it for a fee, charging much lower rates than prison-contracted phone companies. Authorized phone calls in jails and prisons cost up to fifty times more than on the outside (Wagner and Jones). &#x21a9;&#xfe0e;\n    \n    \n      According to Business insider, ATG was founded in February 3, 2000 and is headquartered in Red Bank, NJ (“Advanced Technologies Group,” Markets Insider). According to Bloomberg, ATG was founded in 1991 and is headquartered in Des Moines, IA (“Advanced Technology Group,” Bloomberg). &#x21a9;&#xfe0e;\n    \n    \n      While JPay CEO Errol Feldman’s salary is not listed as far as I can see, JPay reported a revenue of $70 million in 2015 (Cobb) and in 2017 a Securus/JPay investor presentation estimated the total market for money transfers in state prisons to be worth $99.2 million in corporate revenue (Raher). &#x21a9;&#xfe0e;\n    \n    \n      Kolibri was developed by Learning Equality, a non-profit organization founded by two former Khan Academy interns and a group of students in 2013 with KA Lite, a platform for accessing Khan Academy offline with a $5 million dollar grant from Google. According to its website, KA Lite has been used in 200 countries and territories around the world and in numerous prisons in the U.S. (Learning Equality). It is not clear how much money Khan Academy is making from business with prisons, but it is worth noting that In 2018 Sal Khan’s annual salary was $824,000 and COO Ginny Lee’s salary was $700,000 (Wikipedia Contributors, “Khan Academy”). &#x21a9;&#xfe0e;\n    \n    \n      Kolibri installers, updates and content need to be downloaded once to a device with an internet connection but then they can be copied from that “seeded” device to other devices over an offline local network. Once Kolibri is installed on a computer, it is run from the command line and opens in a browser. &#x21a9;&#xfe0e;\n    \n    \n      On March 22 in La Modelo prison in Bogota 23 people died in a riot that started as a protest against insanitary conditions and insufficient protection from Coronavirus infection in a prison complex (BBC). In U.S. prisons Covid-19 is spreading so fast that it is almost certainly completely out of control (Park et al). &#x21a9;&#xfe0e;\n    \n  \n\n",

  title: "5. Minimal computing",
  author: null,
  layout: "narrative",
  content: "Definition, philosophy, history\n\nMinimal computing is an emerging conversation in digital humanities about the need for computing solutions in parts of the world where people have only limited access to internet connections and digital technologies. This lack of access, as well as the learning curves that accompany it, exclude huge segments of the world population from participating in digital work. Historically, the cost of purchasing hardware and learning to use complex programming languages has kept digital scholarship disproportionally in largely endowed institutions in the northern hemisphere. Minimal computing emerged in response to the need to decolonize discourse in and about the Global South and its diasporas by making technology more widely accessible, independent and easy to use. Alex Gil notes that many academics who are called to take part in institutional initiatives that seek to promote inclusion and diversity are also engaged in the economically challenged spheres and hemispheres where fundamentals of computing are scarce (“Design”).\n\nThe material inequalities that minimal computing engages with make it a critical movement that asks for balance between gains and costs in areas that include social justice issues and de-manufacturing and reuse, and the effects of e-waste. Ownership of records and files and control over knowledge production are tremendously important and even more so in places where records and documents are subject to censorship or seizure by authorities and political groups. Minimal computing thus seeks ways to use computers under significant constraints of hardware, software, education, network capacity, global relationships of power and knowledge production, and other economic, infrastructural and material conditions, including issues of aesthetics, culture and the environment.\n\nMinimal computing seeks solutions that can live on physical devices rather than proprietary clouds, and includes the maintenance, refurbishing, and use of machines which are not high performance as well as machines built specifically for high performance in specific tasks but with minimal additional needs. One of the key building blocks used in minimal computing is a static site. Unlike a dynamic site, which only comes into existence when the reader summons it up by with a click of their mouse, a static site already exists in the files on the computer and can be generated without a connection to the internet. Gil’s description of the difference between a static site and a dynamic site is helpful in understanding how important this difference is:\n\n\n  A static site differs from a dynamic one in the way the documents are produced, not in whether they are interactive or not on the front-end, a common misconception. A static site is produced long before the reader asks for one of its documents on the browser. A dynamic site is produced on the fly, at the moment the reader asks for a document on the browser. In most cases, a static site implies the absence of a database. This has enormous implications for the production of literary documents that have hopes of becoming part of a record. Having your documents recreated every single time you need them based on an algorithm is probably not a good bet for the sake of longevity, not to mention the cost of using electricity to re-create the document every time, when once or twice probably suffices.1\n\n\nJust by browsing through its elegant front end, one would never know that archipelagos - a journal of Caribbean digital praxis - is housed on a static site. archipelagos is a platform for open-ended and multiform engagement through the creation of archives, databases, cartographic applications and other digital projects among the people of the Caribbean and its diasporas (archipelagos)1  . It is fully open access and charges no author fees or copyright privileges. The archipelagos website and PDFs are generated from markdown files using Jekyll and ConTeXt2, respectively, resulting in a lightweight mobile-friendly website that works well with mobile phones, bandwidth differentials, and Caribbean data costs. archipelagos’ philosophy, described on its “About Us” page, perfectly exemplifies the radical potential of minimal computing for digital humanities work: “[its] cutting edge comes […] not from a misguided sense of techno-utopianism—or worse, techno-determinism—but as a new small axe, hacking away still at that master’s house” (archipelagos).\n\nAn example of how minimal computing work can preserve historical information, strengthen cultural ties and enrich the geographic imagination is the Sudan Memory project, which used a variety of minimal computing methods to digitize and conserve written and photographic material pertaining to 19 major ethnic groups and including over 100 languages and dialects that was being held in Sudanese cultural institutions, where decades of war had put much of the cultural heritage and practices recorded in Sudanese archives under threat. This project, led in 2018-19 by Professor Marylin Deegan of Kings College in London, U.K., set up a professional cataloguing and digitization service in Khartoum as well as on roving facilities in other regions. A team of researchers and archivists digitized a large volume of at-risk content, including 100,000 maps, more than 10 million fragile photographs and AV materials documenting disappearing cultures and customs, and staff and volunteers in local cultural institutions were trained with the view to building digitisation and conservation capacity in Sudan in the future (“Conserving Sudanese Cultural Heritage”).\n\nThis kind of digital conservation work can also be done with Wax, an exciting minimal computing project for producing digital exhibitions focused on longevity, low costs, and flexibility. Wax produces beautifully rendered, high-quality image collections and scholarly exhibits by means of Ruby gems for processing image data and associated metadata which live as digital exhibitions on a static site built with the Wax Jekyll theme. Thanks to the way it tiles images, Wax’s files are flat and weigh very little, making it a truly portable offline alternative to Omeka3. The Wax project was led by Marii Nyröp in 2018 and is currently maintained by Marii Nyröp and Alex Gil at Columbia University Libraries. It uses open source libraries and frameworks including Jekyll, IIIF, OpenSeaDragon, Rake, and ElasticLunr. Wax sites use flat HTML, CSS, and JavaScript files that do not need to communicate in a complex way back to a server. This makes them cheap, safe, and generally easier to maintain than some of the heavier software for displaying graphics that many of us may be familiar with. The skills needed to create Wax sites are largely transferable for use in other digital projects, such as making standardized image files and metadata records and builds around them, handling canonical information, scholarly content, and site styling.\n\nWax has a relatively high but general-purpose learning curve which includes using the command line, git, Jekyll, creating and normalizing data files, using file-naming conventions and best practices, and editing HTML, CSS, and some JavaScript (Wax). Wax can serve well as a pedagogical tool for teaching these skills but may be too ambitious for an introductory digital humanities course. However, wax is a good workflow for building collections of graphical resources for use in digital humanities projects and could become a library for students in prison to use.\n\nNo Connect is another minimal computing project that could be fun to use in a prison classroom. It is a template for Jekyll static site generator that works on a local machine or a USB key, without an html server, based on the standard Jekyll theme and developed by Alex Gil and Dennis Tenen at Columbia’s Group for Experimental Methods in the Humanities in 2015. It taps into the affordances of sneakernets4 and has as one of its goals to “carve out space for digital work to continue under adverse circumstances” such as those caused by an unfriendly government or copyright regimes (Gil and Tenen). Committing text and code to memory on USB sticks may prove too volatile to do in prisons given their strict prohibitions on recording information and their definitions of contraband. Maybe, however, if the instructor is held accountable for all student use of devices, it could be allowed.\n\nUSB memory sticks and a case of laptops were taken into Rikers Island correctional facility by Columbia’s Experimental Methods Group in 2015, for what is probably the most exciting minimal computing project done in prison in the U.S..  Rikers Story Bot is a coding workshop and an algorithmic storytelling project that started as an initiative from the Center for Justice at Columbia University, with the idea of running an “Intro to Python” workshop for the young people incarcerated at Rikers and for Columbia University students interested in digital literacy (Rikers Bot). Students built a twitter bot with Python and narrated their story in tweets, establishing a chain of communication between communities on the outside and the jail. As of May 3, 2020, there are 529 Rikers Bot tweets. The most recent is from 2018. Not much was needed to carry out this powerful project, and a tremendous amount – for the participants, the public including the academic communities and other communities, and the historical record - was gained.\n\nIn a discussion about minimal computing something must be said about the Rasberry Pi, a series of small single-board computers developed in the U.K. in 2009 for teaching basic computer science in schools and around the world. In 2014, James Smithies and a team of developers launched a digital humanities project consisting in building a virtual research environment (VRE)5 on a Rasberry Pi. Smithies’s goal was “to use a minimal computer and free software to create a prototype environment that is under my control, without the constraints and expectations of a large project, and (crucially) capable of ongoing extension and elaboration by a lone scholar” (“Full Stack DH”). The choice to build a VRE on a Rasberry Pi is interesting because Rasberry Pis have very limited computational power, so if something works on a Pi it would arguably work on almost any device. Smithies’s VRE at jamessmithies.org is an API built with Django, a Python-based web framework designed for newspaper websites. While jamessmithies.org looks like a website, it has a blog that incorporates a Twitter Feed as well as a complete downloadable Ubuntu operating system, among other resources.\n\nSmithies’s VRE experiment is also interesting from a minimal computing perspective because Rasberry Pis are cheap. A closer look, however, shows that if you want to use a Pi as you would a laptop, it is not really that cheap. The Pi basic computer or mother board costs between $35 [1 GB RAM] and $55 [4 GB RAM] (“Rasberry Pi 4”). To turn that into a laptop, you can buy a desktop kit for about $120 from Rasberry Pi (“Products”). In addition to this you still need a monitor and keyboard, so the price is about the same as buying a cheap laptop and installing Ubuntu, which is free and open source (Smithies installed Ubuntu on a Rasberry Pi to replace Raspbian, the closed source operating system that comes with the Rasberry Pi). And all of this is a lot of work, which, as noted by Gil in 2015 in “The User, the Learner and the Machines we Make,” comes with a steep learning curve and thus one of the constraints that minimal computing, as opposed to minimalist computing, aims to avoid (Gil, “The User”).\n\nIt is interesting to get involved in the material affordances of the hardware we use.There is a lot to learn from people in the global south who are by necessity much more resourceful and experienced in negotiating material affordances than most people in the U.S.. However, my goal is to build things with computer programs rather than build computers, and if I am operating in a place where there is no hardware at all and do not necessarily have advanced technical skills, the Pi is not a good choice. I am much better off using a cheap, refurbished or donated laptop, installing Ubuntu, and collaborating via a LAN. However, an interesting takeaway from Smithies’s minimal approach is that because he hosted his VRE on a a tiny computer with only 2GB RAM for three years6, he showed how much can be done if files and programs are kept as lightweight as possible so that they can be accessed or run on any device.\n\nMinimal computing does not aim to replace complex systems, but rather to work in tandem with them. The work that digital humanists develop using complex systems – for example, Manifold Scholarship7, which allows independent writers to publish beautifully curated works, or Omeka, notably used in projects like Preserve the Baltimore Uprising 20158, which digitally preserves crowdsourced content that documents the events surrounding the death of Freddie Gray - is excellent use made of powerful tools. It is of the utmost importance that minimal computing solutions be relied on alongside complex systems so as to enrich the academy with more practitioners who do not have access to powerful computers or reliable broadband.\n\nBecause digital humanities has broken away from the academy in many ways at the same time that it is increasingly becoming an integral branch of most scholarly fields, it welcomes non-traditional practitioners, and its collaborative yet dispersed approach to project development  can afford a degree of privacy that might be reassuring to people just out of prison and starting to look for new footholds in an unfamiliar world. Digital humanities inherited a lot from communities of hackers where outcasts and otherwise marginalized people found relatively safe places to be at home. It is therefore a real way to bring in and retain non-traditional students in our universities.9 Because minimal computing’s search for solutions revolves around the central question of what is needed and explores how to meet these needs at minimal cost, it is exciting to approach teaching digital skills in prison, where needs and constraints are very specific, in this way.\n\n\n\nMinimal computing and pedagogy\n\nA classroom limited by the significant constraints particular to prisons is an interesting place to develop technical skills, because everything has to be built from scratch. Building from the ground up is the best way to acquire solid digital skills. An artisanal approach gives learners tools to engage in sustainable practices with a lot more freedom and versatility than if they were to learn digital humanities methods of inquiry with “soft” tools such as Omeka, TEI, Voyant, Scalar, Tableau and Carto, which we cannot use anyway because they mostly require a connection to the internet, which prisons do not have. Furthermore, because one of the main aims of teaching digital humanities in prison is to empower students by giving them autonomy and control over what they produce, it is preferable to stay away from ready-made interfaces we do not own. After leaving prison, students who completed an introduction to digital humanities course will be well prepared to learn to use any number of interfaces they might need to get a job, all the while conserving an understanding of the larger political and socio-economic context such interfaces exist in. Gil observes that by learning methods of digital humanities inquiry with the abovementioned soft tools, “students learn very little about computation, systems, networks, and by extension the social implications of the modes of production that they enable. Even more importantly,” writes Gil, “use of these tools hides the vectors of control, governance and ownership over our cultural artifacts” (“Design”).\n\n\n\n\n\nSolutions for working under prison constraints\n\nHardware\n\nIf the introduction to digital humanities I envision were offered to, say, fifteen incarcerated students, it could be done with seventeen laptop computers, one per student, one for the instructor and one which would function as the local server. These would all be connected through a Local Area Network (LAN).10 The LAN connection would provide students with access to the course syllabus, readings and tutorials, and allow them to share work, edit and annotate code and texts, engage in conversations on a blog, build and play games, and do a lot more. The LAN connection setup is simple and inexpensive, and, especially if it is hardwired, allows users to share large files without a connection to the internet.\n\nIn the setup I imagine in prison, the LAN could be established in two ways. One of these would be to connect the server laptop to a router and a network switch (the network switch would expand the number of ports on the router). The other way would be to hardwire the LAN by connecting the server laptop only to the network switch, and the network switch to the other laptops. In this case no router would be needed. From a minimal computing perspective, it is preferable to use only the switch, as we are interested in avoiding the use of more hardware than we need. If, however, some functionality only the router can provide is needed, a router should obviously also be used. If possible, each student should be given a USB to practice a lot of version control (Git). These USB sticks would serve the same function as GitHub in a very rudimentary way, allowing students to push and pull changes to shared repositories.\n\nSoftware and operating system\n\nIn the Intro to DH course model I developed as part of this project course readings and tutorials for learning technical skills are made available to students on a static site built with Ed., a Jekyll theme developed by Alex Gil.  This pedagogical use might be a new use of Ed., but it is adapting beautifully. At one point I considered using Hugo, another static site generator, because Ed. does not work very well with Windows as of yet (at that point I was considering using PCs).\n\nI chose to work with Linux rather than Mac OS or Windows because Linux is free and open source. Furthermore, it bundles Ed. beautifully.11 A big concern when making the choice to go with Linux was that for purposes of using their newly acquired technical skills to gain employment after leaving prison, it would be good for students to be familiar with an operating system more widely used. Macs were out on account of their price. After some deliberation I bought a cheap Dell laptop, wiped out its Windoows operating system and installed Ubuntu (Linux), to see how that felt. It felt great and will be perfect for students who are learning to code.\n\n\n\n  \n    \n      archipelagos was sx archipelagos, part of the Small Axe Project, an integrated publication undertaking devoted to Caribbean intellectual and artistic work administered by Small Axe Incorporated, a not-for-profit organization established in New York State which aims “to participate both in the renewal of practices of intellectual and cultural criticism in the Caribbean and in the expansion and revision of the scope and horizons of such criticism” through an “ethos of generative rethinking” embodied in Small Axe (the site), sx salon (a scholarly journal), sx visualities (visual art), and sx archipelagos (an online journal and platform for digital practice, now archipelagos) (Small Axe). &#x21a9;&#xfe0e; &#x21a9;&#xfe0e;2\n    \n    \n      ConTeXT is a free and portable text editor for Windows which has not been developed in a while. I wonder if archipelagos uses ConTeXt because it found that it was compatible with the software people use widely in the Caribbean and diasporas. &#x21a9;&#xfe0e;\n    \n    \n      Omeka is a free, open-source content management system for online digital collections used by many librarians and archivists around the world (Omeka). &#x21a9;&#xfe0e;\n    \n    \n      Sneakernet is an informal term for the transfer of electronic information by physically moving media such as magnetic tape, floppy disks, optical discs, USB flash drives or external hard drives between computers, rather than transmitting it over a computer network (Wikipedia Contributors, “Sneakernet”). &#x21a9;&#xfe0e;\n    \n    \n      A Virtual Research Environment or Virtual Laboratory is an online system that allows researchers to collaborate. &#x21a9;&#xfe0e;\n    \n    \n      Smithies served his VRE from a Rasberry Pi from 2014 to 2017, when he moved it to a Rock64, a tiny single board computer built by Pine64 (“Rock 64”), and then, in 2019, migrated jamessmithies.org to a virtual private server, “mainly to reduce security risk to [his] home network” (“Site Design”). &#x21a9;&#xfe0e;\n    \n    \n      Manifold Scholarship, for example, is an open-source publishing platform developed by humanities scholars at the CUNY Graduate Center, the University of Minnesota Press and Cast Iron Coding with a grant from the Andrew W. Mellon Foundation. Manifold enables authors and publishers a means to showcase their work as web-based editions in a smooth and elegant reader which works on all browsers, with built-in annotation, commenting systems, and dynamic and direct layering, to “transform scholarly publications into living digital works” (Manifold). It exemplifies how complex systems can be used to bridge gaps between scholars with less means and academic communities with more. &#x21a9;&#xfe0e;\n    \n    \n      Preserve the Baltimore Uprising 2015 is a digital repository that seeks to preserve and share original content captured and created by witnesses to the protests that followed the death of Freddie Gray in 2015. Built with Omeka, the Preserve the Baltimore Uprising project was developed by the Maryland Historical Society, Baltimore-area university faculty members, museums, and community organizations (Preserve the Baltimore Uprising).

  title: "6. P2CP at Otisville - a Case Study and Possible Proposal",
  author: null,
  layout: "narrative",
  content: "Why Otisville\n\nThe Prison-to-College Pipeline (P2CP) program is CUNY’s college-in-prison program. It is run by the Institute for Justice and Opportunity at John Jay College of Criminal Justice at Otisville Correctional Facility in upstate New York.  P2CP is a robust, proven program that has been in place since 2011 and aims to further CUNY’s mission of providing higher education to everyone who is eligible to go to college. This, notes P2CP Founding Director Baz Draesinger, “includes the prison population on a very basic level, [many of whom] did not have access to higher education to begin with or quality education before that.” In a sense, she said, “we’re enacting our duty as a society to offer people the education that they should have gotten in the first place” (“The Prison-to-College Pipeline”). These goals align perfectly with the goals of this project, namely, to extend opportunities for academic success within the field of digital humanities to incarcerated people and teach them transferrable skills that will serve them in seeking employment upon release. If an introductory digital humanities course were developed and piloted with P2CP students at Otisville, the students would benefit, the field of digital humanities would grow and benefit, and the mission of CUNY would be further advanced.\n\nP2CP is funded by the Institute for Justice and Opportunity, and some tuition costs are covered by Obama’s First Step Act. CUNY professors travel to Otisville, which is 75 miles from the city, to teach accredited, credit-bearing college courses in English, sociology, anthropology, mathematics, and other liberal arts disciplines. There are also guest speakers, academic counseling, skills development workshops and the Learning Exchange, a credit-bearing course facilitated by a CUNY faculty member to expose students to academic topics beyond the standard course offerings and gives students at Otisville an opportunity to network with their peers from John Jay. Because P2CP is part of CUNY, P2CP students may want to go on to specialize in digital humanities or fields of study that incorporate digital humanities within CUNY and would receive support.\n\n\n\nLogistics\n\nHardware\n\nAn introduction to digital humanities course for fifteen students would require seventeen laptops. Fifteen of these would be individual student laptops, one would be the instructor’s laptop, and the seventeenth would act as the server. Individual laptops would either be wired to the server with a LAN switch or connected wirelessly to the server via a router. The instructor(s) would also have one or two external hard drive(s) and/or USB stick for backup, course readings and additional resources. Two external CD/DVD drives would also be needed; one which would remain in the facility to read CD-ROMs and the other, which would not be brought to the prison, for the instructor(s) to burn additional software, programs and course material files to CD-ROMs if needed.\n\nPrograms and software\n\nIn traditional digital humanities courses, we rely greatly on resources available through the internet. Here, everything would have to live on sixteen laptops, USB sticks and the external hard drive(s). The computer programs and learning resources for the envisioned introduction to digital humanities course would be pre-installed on student laptops and/or the instructor(s)’s laptop. Students would submit assignments, share their work with each other and collaborate on projects through Ubuntu’s Public Folder, which would be accessed through the local network, and/or by using USB drives. Some of the built-in applications that come with Ubuntu, including the Libre Office suite and the three games (solitaire, mines and sudoku), could be made available to students.\n\nCourse delivery\n\nA lot of the envisioned course would be delivered digitally in class on the course laptops. Readings can be both digital and printed. The printed reading matter can be assigned as homework. A lot of coding logic can also be assigned as homework and done with pen and paper, then tried out in class. Students should probably each be assigned a laptop at the beginning of the semester and continue to use the same laptop throughout the semester, as this would allow them to save things they are working on individually and give them ownership over their work and accountability for what they do with the laptop.\n\nBecause learning digital skills usually involves a lot of practice, it would be great if students were allowed to use their laptops in tutoring and/or study sessions outside of class.\n\nAccessibility\n\nThe envisioned course site follows and must continue to follow the World Wide Web Consortium’s Web Content Accessibility Guidelines (WCAG) Version 2.1 in order to make electronic content accessible to everyone who uses it. Following the CUNY Policy on Equal Opportunity and Non-Discrimination and in keeping with the guideline’s in CUNY’s IT accessibility Statement, the envisioned introduction to digital humanities course aims not only to be accessible but also to show students how to produce work within guidelines that makes their work accessible to everyone.\n\nSecurity\n\nIt would probably be best if all hardware remained on the facility. This way the security screening of the hardware would only have to be done twice, once at the beginning of the course and once at the end (unless it stays in the prison for subsequent use). If the instructor(s) needed to bring additional material such as computer programs, software or files to the facility, it might be a good idea to bring these on a read-only CD-ROM rather than a USB because in New York State prisons all removable storage devices are contraband (Directive 4911, Attachment A).\n\nFor security reasons it might be best if students worked on the same computer in each class session for the duration of the course and saved their work on that computer. It would be good if students could also save their work on USBs, which could be labeled and kept with the laptops.\n\nOne of the exciting challenges that this course presents is to map out and prepare everything students need to achieve course learning goals in ways that work around significant prison-specific constraints.\n\nHardware cost estimate\n\nMinimal computing prompts us to find computing solutions only for what is really needed, at the lowest possible cost. The hardware listed here is what seems to me strictly necessary for the delivery of the course, keeping in mind monetary cost, cost in labor and cost in student effort as well as other hidden costs. As there may be a computer lab at Otisville Correctional Facility, I considered whether the course could be done without the laptops. I imagine that it could, but relying on computers probably with Windows operating systems and a variety of programs already installed would make it a lot more difficult to set up, and would entail troubleshooting issues that would almost certainly arise during installation as well as in class. In my opinion what we gain in working in Ubuntu, a free open source operating system widely used by software developers, justifies the cost of buying seventeen laptops.\n\nThe following estimate is for the hardware only; I have not estimated the cost of travel to and from Otisville or instructor(s) stipend(s) or anything else.\n\n\n  \n    \n      item\n      price per item\n      quantity needed\n      cost\n    \n    \n      Laptop\n      $350\n      17\n      $5,950\n    \n    \n      24-port LAN switch and cables or wireless router\n      $200\n      1\n      $200\n    \n    \n      External CD/DVD drive\n      $45\n      2\n      $90\n    \n    \n      Box of blank CDs\n      $10\n      1\n      $10\n    \n    \n      Unforeseen expenses\n      $100\n      1\n      $100\n    \n    \n       \n       \n      TOTAL\n      $6,350\n    \n  \n\n\n\n\nSample course content\n\nA model-in-development for an introduction to digital humanities course for prison is on this website’s sibling site Intro to DH\n\n\n",

  layout: "narrative",
  content: "DH in Prison and Intro to DH are static sites. This makes the rate of decay of their pages substantially lower than that of dynamic or database-driven systems. Neither of the sites rely on external web-based extensions or plugins to generate their pages. This makes their pages extremely stable. To ensure future compatibility with web hosting services and other devices, the versions of Ruby and Jekyll that make the sites run should be updated periodically, but if this is done once or twice a year everything should be fine.\n\nThe site architecture/code of DH in Prison and Intro to DH depend on Ed., the Jekyll theme they were built with. Ed. is licensed under an MIT license which guarantees that I own the software and it cannot be taken away. The Ed. Jekyll theme was built by Alex Gil within the Global Outlook Minimal Computing working group based at Columbia University and has remained stable and up to date since its release in 2016. As a minimal edition, Ed. is relatively easy to build and modify, and its static pages require less bandwidth than most dynamic sites.\n\nWhile most websites are written in markup languages such as Extensible Markup Language (XML), Intro to DH uses kramdown syntax, a variation of Markdown syntax, which, as human readable plain text, requires a much lower learning curve than markup languages do. This makes content easy to update and change without requiring programming expertise, wherefore this project can easily expand and grow. By using kramdown syntax we eliminate the need to have technical experts deploy and maintain this work, thus expanding access to contributors.\n\nDH in Prison and Intro to DH are hosted on Reclaim Hosting, an internet hosting service that provides educators, institutions and students domains and web hosting. These domains cost at most $65 a year are transferable, so if this project grows into larger community effort, it will continue to have its domains\n\n\n",

  layout: "narrative",
  content: "As the global coronavirus pandemic kills hundreds of thousands of people around the world, ravages prisons, detention centers, meatpacking factories and nursing homes, and causes millions of low income people to put their health and safety at risk, we are in a changed world. Digital technologies play a huge part in worker safety and employability and companies and public agencies move more and more of their operations online.  Many academic, social, civic and devotional communities have largely moved online. Now more than ever it is imperative that incarcerated people acquire the skills they need to reintegrate into an increasingly technological world. As waves of this pandemic return and continue to physically isolate us from each other, digital literacy is a basic requirement to go back to school, work and hold fragile communities together.\n\nIf people recently released from prison succeed in their reentry into society, we all succeed in making our communities better, more humane and safer places to live. Teaching digital skills in the context of digital humanities provides us with the opportunity to question and critically assess our relationships with and within the technology-driven infrastructures that govern or affect almost every aspect of society at the present time. By gaining a bit more understanding of what computers do and what we can do with them, we gain a lot more agency, ownership and control over our lives, which in turn allows us to continue to fight for a happier, more just and more equitable world.\n\n\n",
